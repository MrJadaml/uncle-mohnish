in charity he invested 100000 in seed capital from his savings to start his business trans tack this return to cool 20 million dollars when he sold out in 2000 his value investing equity fund performance returned to cumulative 517 percent from 2000 when his astounding yield was disclosed publicly by Forbes in 2013 the comparable return to S&P 500 index investors over the same period was a paltry 43% born in Mumbai - the son of an itinerant magician he was nearly frightened out of going into business on his own by his father's ill-fated attempt sat at the preneur ship this phobia persisted even after finishing a valuable engineering degree at Clemson University we owe our gratitude to his father who pushed him to go out on his own for if not I would not have the great honour to say that the University of Puerto Rico Student Alumni Association welcomes one of the greatest value investors in the world Mohnish Pabrai thank you for the warm welcome I wish my kids and wife were here to hear that garden me some brownie points well it is a pleasure to be here and true honor and it is always great to be be in San Juan what I wanted to to do today is you know in some ways you guys are guinea pigs because i have never given this talk before which kind of makes it interesting for me as Professor Scott mentioned that i am a huge fan of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger especially Charlie Munger and Charlie Munger talks about something known as the latticework of mental models and these are kind of idiosyncrasies in our brains which kind of distort reality for most of us because we have gone through you know millennia in terms of evolution and it is a huge advantage if you are aware of these distortions and can can leverage them and so Charlie's given a speech called a psychology human misjudgment and there is a video on YouTube and PDFs on the web so I encourage you to go through those what I wanted to do today is there is I think Charlie talks on maybe 30 mental models I'd like to go into three mental models none of those thirty these are three that have had a significant positive impact on my life and none of the three are were kind of obvious to me when I got going so I hope some of them are valuable to you and and and can can hopefully have some trajectory change in terms of kind of how you how you go about life if you will so the first the first mental model and I think I encountered this probably close to close to 19 or 20 years ago and I read a book and it is a very kind of unusual book called power versus force was written by kind of a new-age guy in Arizona David Hawkins and he had an unusual pieces in the book and what he said was that if I lie to you and in your conscious state you do not know i am lying to you in your subconscious state you do and what happens is that what what David Hawkins said is that if we put some kind of meters on your body you would register an impact to your muscles going weak what you call going weak when i am lying to you or when someone is lying to you and the the reverse of that is that if someone is saying the truth to you then you tend to feel really good being around that person and I do not know i have never tested whether the muscular reaction actually there or not but we actually know some of this to be true kind of anecdotally so for example if I go to buy a used car for some from some used car dealer I do not know what part of what he is telling me is a lie or whether all of it is a lie but what I do know is I do not feel great being around that person ok and if I go meet let us say that the lie Lama I probably feels very nice being around the person even if he is not saying much I feel good and in many ways i have experienced that with people like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and and such so what what Hawkins said is that there is a you can say a log scale in terms of lies versus truth so if you if you if I buy into what he is saying for example he would say that if I dyed my hair or put in a put on a toupee or something it is a lie and it will probably make the people interacting would be slightly less positive about the interaction if I wear fancy clothes it is a lie so basically the lies and truth is not so much related to just what we say it is about the entire entire experience and the flipside is that when you say the truth and people really kind of go strong and they like it and one of the so so first of all I found the whole theory of this lies versus truth kind of interesting and what I what I started doing about 20 years ago is I started running experiments just around around people around me and so one of the one of the changes I made is I was generally I would say a pretty truthful person but I try to get rid of what I would call the small white lies if you will and and I found that they were very huge positive impacts and so for example you know let us say my wife and I are about to go out for like a dinner movie date and she gets dressed and she says you know how do I look and let us say for example i am not wild and crazy about a dress she is wearing the old Mohnish would have said you look great let us go you know and the new moon it says well you know the dress you know they could be you could put on a different one it could be better blah blah and then of course the immediate impact of saying something like that is the date might be history you know we might not be going on and and that happened that happened a few times but but what what also happened is what I realize is that the relationship actually became stronger because because now I think that most times when i am asked something by by her she has a very high degree of confidence that usually she is going to get a very very straight answer even if it is not the answer she wants to hear and so one of the quirks of all these lies and truth is that humans humans do not care and this is this kind of strange but humans do not care what the truth is they care that you do say the truth so let us say for example and and what I mean by this is we as humans understand that all of us are flawed that all of us make mistakes and that all of us have our you know our bad habits and such and to the extent that we are transparent about them it makes the humans that you are interacting with in David Hawkins Hawkins terms go strong so so for example let us let us take a extreme kind of example of that the extreme example would be let us say someone killed someone you know commit murder and in court they are honest and say you know something happened there was four of them for the moment they were passions flying high whatever explains what happened and owns the crime and says you know I did this i am sorry whatever but but it is all exactly what they truly feel versus someone who's as the same act and goes in court and tells the court what his lawyer tells him to tell them which is either plead the fifth or I have nothing to say or I did not do anything and humans are much more able to forgive even very egregious crimes if the person comes coming fourth is honest and what i have repeatedly found like so for example in 2008 my funds during the financial crisis were down a lot we actually lost 2/3 of our value much more than the indices in that year and when when I was writing my letter to partners you know saying what happened I could have taken two approaches one approach I could have taken would have been let us say the old monitor said look there is the financial crisis everything's been marked down all our stuff got marked down things will recover okay that is one way I could kind of present it which is put the blame on some external event the second way I could deal with it which is the truth which is yes we had the financial crisis which led to a decline in our values but they are also these mistakes I made and go into some detail of the mistakes and kind of what happened and so it is not black and white that it happened because of an external event I was personally responsible for stupid things that I did which caused these losses right and so obviously I took the latter approach because i have been testing this theory for a long time and you know I had not committed murder like I just told you so much lower crime than murder and and quite frankly the reaction I found was extremely benign you know I think there is like 500 450 or 500 families that have invested with us I probably got like two phone calls and maybe a couple of emails about the whole thing you know and and even those are mostly you know supportive and whatever so I did not really kind of get much in terms of people being upset or or whatever else and and I do not want to make this talk political but we have I think event which is going to have more viewership than the Super Bowl tonight and so we will carefully thread into politics for a second so you know I think Donald Trump's made a statement along the lines of that he could go on Fifth Avenue and shoot a bunch of people and it would have no impact on his ratings I may be missing the quote somewhat but he is made some statement I need made many statements which sound outrageous if you will and and he is right what happens is his ratings do not get affected you can call him the Teflon candidate you know bounces right off and why does it bounce right off well my theory of why it bounces right off is plays into the same powers as force which is humans are sick and tired of politicians kind of giving them you know political well packaged talk about what is going on and with my theory if you will obey with Hawkins theory most of them can see through it and so what they appreciate I think the the folks who are you know Trump supporters I think what they appreciate is the breath of fresh air they appreciate the candor and so Trump is exactly right that he he what what people appreciated that he is not saying whatever he is saying because some PR firm told him that is what you should say in fact he does the exact opposite the PR firms tell them what about us and then he just goes there and does what we want to do and i am sure if if I was advising the Donald I would tell him tonight just be yourself you know do not try to be somewhere someone else be yourself and amazingly you know President Obama gave two words of advice to Secretary Hillary Clinton and he told her just two words she said be yourself and and I think that if she is herself which which may be somewhat difficult for her but let us say if she is I think she'll get a lot of points for for being like that and so we actually in my opinion be seen we have seen that kind of play out in the real world so you know there is there is a lot of students here which is great and so what I wanted to say to the students about the truth versus lies is the the thing that you should start experimenting with the core in your age you can actually make changes is start getting rid of the small white lies and and basically sometimes it is uncomfortable sometimes you are afraid you might offend someone bite the bullet you know so between so what i have always done is not always but for at least a couple of decades if I have to choose between truth and diplomacy I choose the truth and it is painful at times it is uncomfortable at times but it has huge payoffs and the second is that the world does not the world does not run based on contracts or you know written legal documents I know with my lawyers here it does not run on that basis but it runs on trust almost everything in the world works on trust and and what happens is that as you go up the log curve the truth log curve and you become more and more and more truthful what happens is that you become more and more trustworthy and trustworthiness is a huge advantage in the world so so to have to have an and it takes time it may take someone knowing you for five 10 20 years to finally understand this is a very highly festival person and the difference between someone who lies ten out of a hundred times versus one out of a hundred times versus one out of a thousand times is exponential in the rewards so if you are lying one out of hundred times this is one out of a thousand the impact on your life would be exponential in terms of what the payoffs are so what I would encourage you to do is give it a try which is that as you go about living your life just just try to push the boundaries of your comfort level especially when you are asked questions which either a lie or a white lie or diplomatic answer or non answer cannot get you out of it try to kind of confront it head-on and you might you might be surprised so that is the first model and I I found it has it has huge huge positive impacts and i have and I what i have seen is that there is an there is a compounding effect so i have been doing this for you know I was I would say I was a pretty honorable guy even before these changes but after the change is what has happened is that the degree of trust that that people have has been a huge tailwind and and it continues to be a tailwind so it is something that is very easy and simple to do and I'd encourage you to do that so the the three models i am going to present are not really particularly connected to each other but I thought they were all three that might add some value to the folks in the room so so that is the that is the first first model the the second model is is the model on compounding so Einstein Einstein said that compounding was the eighth wonder of the world and and it is so so we all we all learn about interest rates and growth of things over time and different things like that but but I think that is it is a huge advantage if you can understand the power of compounding and if you can do a bunch of math related to compounding in your head so what i am going to do is just kind of throw out some some terms and some of the math actually that we are going to do I have not done myself so i will be doing it on the fly which would be kind of fun so so i will take one example from a letter Warren Buffett wrote to his investors in the nineteen fifties I think it was like 58 or 59 and he said that the the Indians the American Indians were based in in Manhattan what was Manhattan in New York in 1626 it is rumored that they sold the island of Manhattan to the Dutch for $24 that was the sale price and of course when people hear that they say you know $24 you know the Indians got taken for a ride and and such but let us say the Minuit Indians I think they were the Minear Indians who did that let us say the minute Indians had some kind of trust officer or investment officer in 1626 and the Dutch came to him and this deal was on the table of $24 and you could sell this undeveloped island so he would he would probably think about well what are my alternative uses if we do not do the deal or what else can we do and he would probably run some numbers and he would have probably concluded there was a fantastic deal and why is it a fantastic deal so let us say that $24 in 1626 that the Indians were able to take that and invested at something like 7% a year for example what would that $24 be today if it were invested at 7% so let us do the math without any pencil paper so we have something known as the rule of 72 which some of you may be familiar with which is that you know if I have a 7% interest rate I can take 72 divided by 7 it is approximately 10 which says that in 10 years at a 7% interest rate the money would double okay so basically if in 1626 they sold for $24 in 1636 they would have $48 in 1646 they'd have $96 and so on it keep doubling every 10 years so basically if you take a hundred year period you get 2 to the power of 10 to the power 10 is a good number to know it is 1024 and let us throw away the 24 because that makes the math a little harder so we have 1000 so in a hundred years whatever they got increases a thousand times so if in 1626 they got 24 in 1724 they have 24000 okay and in 1818 23 or whatever they have 1825 they have 24 million and by 1925 they have 24 billion and 20 25 which is 9 years from now they have 24 trillion right now we are about 10 years away from the 24 trillion and 10 years of the double so today they would have about 12 trillion right so we did the math without a calculator which is great well done Mohnish okay and and the thing is you can do the math yourself also without and the important thing with compounding is to have the fluency to do it in your head because it is very important to be able to do this in your head because it has huge impacts so $24 in 1626 7 percent compounded is today 2 trillion so what is the value of undeveloped so let us say Manhattan today the land of Manhattan if it had if it had no buildings on it and or let us say let us put it this way if I were to go and offer to buy everything in Manhattan and then I subtract the cost of the buildings which is the land value because undeveloped land would the land be at 12 trillion right and the answer to that also is very simple so the entire wealth of the planet every man woman child everything their own is 300 trillion the entire wealth of the United States is 80 trillion it is very unlikely that something like 15% of that 80 trillion is just Manhattan land that is that is that is a and in fact I think Warren calculated that I think he calculated in the 1960 or something it was twelve and a half or twelve billion or something actually was less than twelve including something at ten billion so you might get to a few hundred billion maybe in value on a good day so the Indians the Indians basically sold Manhattan at a at a rate where if they are held today they are held that land till today and they did a deal today they would have basically lost several trillion in value by by not doing the real now of course the the trust office of the minute Indians was an idiot in terms of investing and he did not get them to twelve trillion but that is a different story we'll get to that later so so how do we get twenty four dollars to become twelve trillion right so let us break that apart let us break that apart there are two factors that lead to the twelve trillion the first factor is the length of time okay length of time is a very important variable in how much your money grows and the second factor is the rate at which it grows right and what we found is that even at a not a very high rate 7% is actually below the SNP is done you get some astounding results now recently I do not know whether you saw in the news there was there was some older gentleman who passed away some in some way in the Northeast he was a librarian you know just middle class librarian all his life and when he passed away he gave the college where he worked for million dollars and everyone was surprised that this guy who was very much a you know middle-class ordinary guy had actually got four million dollars saved up and of course these journalists wrote the article do not know how to do math and they did not attend the lecture that we are just having so they did not understand kind of how things work with get to get four million so let us take a situation okay so let us say there is an eighteen year old and let us say this eighteen year old has very few skills and he only get a minimum-wage job right and so he is making you know something like 15000 per year working 2000 hours so and let us say for example he is able to save something like 10% maybe hard but let us say he is living at home etcetera saves 10% of that 15000 before taxes because he can put it in the high array or something and so his his actual kind of after-tax income might decline by a thousand if he is working someplace that there is an employer match some of you students will get employer matches and such and retirement account so you might have to save less to get more so if this person is 18 years old saves $1500 and let us say he keeps putting their 1500 every year into retirement account and let us say for example that he gets that something like a 7% return on that money and let us say that his income goes up very modestly like his income is only going up by two percent a year and when it goes up by two percent is a year his savings go up by two percent a year so instead of saving 1500 next year he saves fifteen hundred and thirty dollars so it goes up very slowly and when he when he retires fifty years from now which is at the age of sixty eight he is at that point fifty years later making less than fifty thousand a year it did not have any significant growth in income just barely kept up with inflation and such what would that person have at the age of 68 well let me make it easy for you the first year the first year when he saves the fifteen hundred he is got fifty years we know it is seven percent we know it doubles every 10 years we know it is two to the power of five we know 2 to the power 5 is 32 and we know what 1500 times 32 is so he is got 48000 right so the first 80 what he saves at 18 at the age of 68 is 48000 age of 19 maybe somewhere similar to that but you get the point as you go on the end result is to make it simpler for you is a little over a million dollars okay so the librarian is not making 15000 he is got a white-collar job he is probably making somewhere less than a hundred and maybe more than 40 or 50000 somewhere in that range and he paid attention when they were talking about compounding in math class you know and and he if he makes four times with the guy with the minimum wage makes without doing anything here so Tarek he ends up with a very significant net worth so so the the the the question is why why does not everyone end up wealthy when we retire because there is not much required to become wealthy you just have to follow a certain game plan and you'll be there and in fact at the age of 68 the guy was making less than fifty thousand he he could start withdrawing fifty thousand or more per year from their account and would outlast the rest of his life because he would have a 5% withdrawal rate and he is got a 7% earnings rate so it the number the money we like to keep growing it he would probably end up making a four million dollar donation to another another school or something so compounding is a very important element to understand and again what matters is it makes a huge difference if that person starts at the age of 18 verses 28 huge difference and my daughter my my younger daughter last year she interned at at a place and she got paid like close to five thousand dollars during the internship and you know expenses inside so the money was just sitting there so I said you know you can open an IRA and so I got it open an IRA and then I said you know if you are if you trust me you can give me power of attorney and I can invest the money for you and one time she was flying back from New York she is very tired and I just saw you know that five thousand dollars you gave me at the age of eighteen it is I put it into one stock you know because you know we can we can take some risk because you just 18 brownie the money and probably that let us talk doubles or triples in the next two or three years because my best stock pick and so I said you know let us say it does not does not even double or triple let us say you know oh the 15% a year or something so 15% rule of 72 every five years things double right and I ran the math for her and I said what is the five thousand become at the age of 68 right so you have got 50 years to the power of ten so you have got ten ten doubles you have got a thousand you get to a thousand times the five thousand which is five million so I said ma ma Qi you know you you worked one summer and the age of 68 you'll have five million from the summer work but then the next summer you going to work again and that'll become five million at the age of 69 and at some point you are gonna graduate and you might make more than five thousand in a year and you might actually save a few thousand dollars and I said what what is your net worth at the age of 68 and I gave us some number and by it was like 2:00 in the morning I was picked up from the airport and Q was asleep and she was wide awake you know oh like how does that happen you know and and what is going on very very very focused and so the the thing is it is it is the two pieces the length of the runway is really important right so 50 years number of doubles it is all about the number doubles it is all Buffett things about it how long does it take things to double so if you asked Warren Buffett mr. Buffett i am the genie from Aladdin you can have any wish you want what would you like you know so you know what he would say he says I only want one wish which is that when i am dead and they look at me they say man he was old okay so so he just wants to not die for as long as possible and it is not like he loves all of us on planet earth is why he does not want to die he wants to compound and he wants to keep compounding for as long as he can and I think in his case in his case he is 86 and he started his compounding journey at the age of 11 and he actually understood compounding I think age 8 of 9 or 10 and I think at 24 or something he told his wife that we are going to be wealthy beyond our dreams we are gonna have more money than we will not know what to do with it and so we got a plan for like you know what are we gonna do with all this extra cash and his wife thought you know this guy is you know because we can I want to buy a house we do not have money to buy a house he thinks we are gonna get super wealthy what is going on and of course they did so so compounding is a very important element no matter what your profession or or you know calling in life ends up being it is very important to have the fluency in math very important to understand the concept of a runway and the length time it takes double and compounding rate and do not take the retirement account of 401k or IRA pull out the money and go on vacation you know the time value destruction of that is huge so that is the that is the second model and very quickly the third model is is that the key the key like like professor Brown mentioned the key to you know I would say a lot of the lot of the things related to developing your full potential or reaching some of your goals may be related to being an entrepreneur you know at some point being able to kind of do things on your own and that sort of thing and of course one of the difficulties that comes up in in being an entrepreneur is that most of us do not have any resources you know we do not have we do not have a rich uncle we I just told you put the money away into this account do not pull out and so we do not have anything to really go out and create things so how do we how do we get a business off the ground and it is important to know kind of how to get a business off the ground and I use this model when when I was trying to get my first business off the ground so there are a hundred and sixty eight hours in a week 24 times seven and if you go to work for some company typically they expect you at least 40 hours a week you might have another five or seven hours so in commute time and so on maybe the other week there is still one hundred and eighteen hours left in the week and in fact if you take out time for eating and sleeping and and other things you will find that there is clearly at least another 40 hours available to you which can be used in a number of different ways and when you are when you are thinking of starting your entrepreneurial journey one simple thing you can do is so one of the biggest things that tell people is when you are going to start a business do not quit your job that is the dumbest thing you can do someone is paying your rent someone is paying for the groceries someone is paying for those dinner dates keep it going do not turn off the faucet right but what you do is you start working on your start up on the second 40 hours so you have your weekends you have evenings you have morning before your work you have all kind of time do that and and at some point when the business is you know getting some traction where you think you can see the light and you got revenue and cash flow and all that then you can go and hand in your resignation and so I was I think 24 years old when I had an idea for my first business and I did not have any money so I was basically just working and working on my business on evenings and weekends and but one of the things I decided is I used to always get great performance reviews I was doing a good job I said I no longer care about performance reviews that is irrelevant to me so I said what is my objective my objective is and I hope my staff is not listening to this but my objective is to work just enough so I do not get fired okay be just slightly above firing level like like like you know I do not need to really burn the midnight oil I do not need to kind of go way overboard I just need to make sure that they feel he is not so bad we only get rid of him but he is not a star right and so and and so I I did this it took it took 11 months from the time I started working on business till the time I was ready to hand in my resignation we had clients and projects and all that is already gone so I went to my boss and I told him hey you know I I have this business and it was not competitive with what they were doing and it is working now and i am gonna resign and so I I had a meeting with my boss and his boss and they said you know your mo Nashville eleven months we were wondering what happened to you you know like we said there is this guy or the great star doing could not figure out like what was going on and I said yeah my my idea was to be just about firing level right he said exactly we discuss should we get rid of you and we said no he is not so bad you know so I said exactly I calibrated it just above just above the level that you would your gel dummy and and of course they were they were of course very supportive and and I and I was very honorable we had to give two weeks notice I warden leave in two weeks but I I told him listen i will stay as long as you want me to and they said can you stay a month to do transitions there is no problem so we did that and actually the the thing is I I left I left that company in 1991 I started for iPhones in 1999 and I think in 2001 both my boss and his boss they became investors in public funds and it was ten years after I had left the company of course I stayed in touch with them but but that is part of the you know goes back to the first model which is the trust model right that you have to and of course even when I was leaving I was very honest with them about hey yeah is exactly right I was a useless worker but slightly above meeting slightly above your firing criteria and and such so that is the third thing which is that and I I tell this to my daughters that they do if you ever decide to go into business for yourself you you can do this you know second 40-hour thing five times and you can fail five times and that is perfectly fine because I had tried two or three times before when I was 24 nothing ever got traction but there was no downside I still had my job I maybe had spent three or four thousand dollars we shot whatever we are doing down and then a few months in there was another idea and eventually one idea had traction and went from there so so the idea is that you find people like Warren says like you like admire and trust you figure out ideas that you think makes sense you can obviously work on them and it is a high probability that if you keep doing that a few times one of those will hit and there is no risk because there is you have you know most things that most young people will do today is technology related IT related app related iPhone related etc none of these things need capital you know it used to be previous businesses you need a lot of capital a lot of businesses you can start today do not take Apple they take what is between your ears so that is the third model is that use the 168 hours and then take it from there
