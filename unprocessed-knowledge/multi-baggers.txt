investing business is that unlike many other endeavors like if you play basketball or cricket or something else is that you can keep getting better at this throughout your life so it is kind of a an endeavor where continuous improvement and learning possible and actually desirable which is which is wonderful so what i wanted to actually kind of talk to you about today is that when we look at this large tent called value investing it encapsulates quite a range of approaches and focuses one could have while trying to create wealth and generate good returns and so on so for example buying a dollar that is trading for 50 cents would be a great way to be a value investor focusing on spin-offs which george greenblatt wrote about is another way focusing on cannibals which is companies that are buying back their stock you know looking at what i call spawners which is businesses that are really good at creating new businesses and then you know spinning those off so that is that is another way one can go focusing on multi-baggers is also well within the within the tent of value investing you know one could do special situation investing merger arbitrage it is a long list of endeavors and initiatives you know ben graham suggested net net investing and so on so there is many different approaches one can take which would all be within the tend to value investing you know they say that you're old too soon and why is too late and i've you know made investments over the last quarter century or more which have covered pretty much almost all of these different ways of looking at things you know we also have things like p or ones you know things trading at low multiples of future video ones and that sort of thing as well what i've been able to glean when i look at all of these different initiatives or different approaches that one can take is that across the globe there are maybe 50 000 or 100 000 stocks in different markets around the world and if one were to say that i only want to invest in companies that are trading at one or two times earnings one can find those one you know cast the net wide and deep one said i only want to buy 50 cent dollars or 30 cent dollars or 20 cent dollars you would find those as well so pretty much i think because the universe of prospective businesses is so wide and so large pretty much any criteria you set could work i think the important thing is that one is very focused in what one is looking for and has clarity of what one is looking for i've come to the conclusion and it is actually a pretty you know it took me a long time to figure this out but i think for most of you it would would seem obvious is if there is such a thing as a best approach out of all of these approaches the best approach i think would be one where one focuses on multibaggers you know businesses that can be a 10x in 10 years or less or maybe 100x in 20 years if one focused purely on the multibands there are some advantages that come up with that approach one advantage is that one doesn't have much in terms of taxes because you'll be holding businesses for a long time under most jurisdictions around the world until the positions are sold unrealized gains are not taxed so basically it gives you an advantage and depending on the place on the planet that you practice this you know sometimes the tax rates can be as high as you know 40 50 deferring that for decades or let's say 10 years or more is a huge advantage because you get a free interest free loan from the government so so there is an advantage in terms of taxes with this approach the second advantage is that you do not have this continuous treadmill of needing to you know find something undervalued then it gets you know fairly valued and then you sell it and then you go look for something else so the multibagger of the multi-bagger approach to investing has a few quirks and it requires us to kind of change our mindset on a few fronts so one of the one of the changes one has to make is that you know traditionally traditionally when one looks at what ben graham kind of you know father of value investing taught us is that you buy something for well below what it is worth and then as it approaches fair value you sell the position and then you you know go look for something else but in a in the multibagger framework what you would do is you would actually not particularly care if a position became fully valued or even overvalued so for example if you bought you know a business for 30 40 cents on the dollar and it is growing that dollar is growing and at some point it is worth 1.50 for example it is gone up more than 50 or what it used to be worth but the stock is trading at two dollars for example so under traditional gramian approaches you would sell that as you get past the dollar fifty or whatever but in in the quest for multi-baggers you would continue to keep it in your portfolio even when it became overvalued you would you would sell it if it became egregiously overvalued so one would need to distinguish between something that is overvalued and something that is egregiously overvalued let's look at some examples of businesses that and you know that might help explain kind of where this approach is coming from and how it might work and so on so if we look at our business let's say mcdonald's for example you know mcdonald's was was formed in the i mean it i mean the business existed but ray kroc took it over in the 1950s i think they went public in the 1960s it is been public for maybe almost 60 years since then it is still growing you know the number of restaurants revenues profits etc i mean it is gone through some ups and downs over the years but it is it is it is grown and it is grown spectacularly and and i think from the time it went public till now it is north of a 10 000 bagger you know every dollar you invested is worth more than ten thousand dollars not a not a ten bag or a hundred bagger like a ten thousand plus bagger and why did mcdonald's do so well it did well because in the early days when when it got going there were a number of initiatives a number of innovations that mcdonald's had come up with some of you might have seen the movie the founder i think the founders i think it is on netflix i'm not sure if it is on netflix in india but you might want to you know i think it is a very good movie to see there is also a biography that got written on mcdonald's called grinding it out it is also a good book it is a very old book but it is a great book to read there is another there is another book which was written by the the first ceo of burger king it is called the burger king and that is actually an amazing book as well but basically one of the early innovations mcdonald's came up with was that everything they sold could be eaten without a fork or a spoon or a knife there was no cutlery needed to you know french fries you could just take it from your hand and so on the other thing the other big innovation was that it was served really fast you know the the production time and actually if you really study mcdonald's internal processes and how it functions it is kind of like a light manufacturing type operation the software and engines they use internally is like what you would use in a light manufacturing operation and of course like for example they were very specific about the way the french fries should be with the russell potatoes so in fact like for example when mcdonald's enters a new country like india or russia etc it takes them two or three years from the time they decide to enter to the time they can open their first restaurant because it takes a couple of years to train the farmers and generate the supply chain for the right kind of potatoes and such so it takes takes them sometimes more than a couple of years just to open the restaurants and such but the interesting thing about something like mcdonald's is that almost all the innovations they came up with there were a lot of copycats and there were many businesses that came up that cloned or tried to clone what they were doing and in general fast food became a huge industry with many players it wasn't just burgers you know we then got a big kind of growth in pizzas chicken kfc so you know a lot of different entrants came in and also i think the on the consumer side it also changed in terms of what the frequency people were looking to eat all of this stuff but anyway even with all of that competition mcdonald's was able to establish a brand people knew before they went into a restaurant any mcdonald's what to expect the kind of standardization and you know consistency the cleanliness the consistency and and the nature of the service worked so that particular moat has been going strong for 60 years there aren't really any signs that say that the moat is eroding and may not do so well in the future they couldn't do well and it is a high it is a very high return on equity business so basically if you think about a franchised mcdonald's where you know an entrepreneur you know you know does a contract with the mcdonald corporation so in a franchise situation in the united states at least a lot of the real estate is owned by the mcdonald's corporation and the rent the rent that is charged to the franchisee is a percentage of sales like maybe around four percent of sales is the rent so if you think about the rent that mcdonald's charges its franchisees it is kind of automatically inflation indexed you know just goes up with inflation they also charge a franchise fee you know for the right to use the brand etc that might be another four percent or so and then the franchisees also buy a lot of the products they need from mcdonald's and usually on mcdonald's and a lot of the other franchise type operations will do is they tend not to focus on making money on the products they tend to focus on you know passing that through but you have the two main engines of the franchise fees and the rent which might be something like seven eight percent off the top line so if you look at it from the mcdonald corporation's point of view a typical mcdonald's in the u.s might have something like two or three million in annual sales and the mcdonald's corporation might get something like you know 150 200 000 a year from that from that location the capital they have to put up against that is almost non-existent because it is the entrepreneur who's you know paying for all the capex and the maintenance capex and all of that so it is a very capital light business so the the three legs that we need you know i think chuck akery called it the three-legged stool the three legs that we need for these long multibaggers is first of all the core economics of the business should have very high returns on invested capital ideally without the use of use of debt right so you basically make like mcdonald's doesn't need to borrow money to make a lot of money the second is that we want very high integrity management and we want insider ownership you know kind of alignment of interest where there is a smart entrepreneur or someone or insiders who own it so they've got incentives and the third is that we want a very long runway so where we can see that this thing can go on for a very long time and i think that when we you know if you were to pick up the annual report of let's say walmart for example walmart went public i think in 1972 or something it is like been public for like 50 years if you picked up the annual report of walmart let's say in 1980 for example a few years seven eight years after they went public you would see that they've got very superior economics at the store level that they generate high returns on equity it is it is a business that does well very very rapid turnover inventory and so on and you would also see that it was embryonic in the sense that large portions of the united states at that time 1980 still did not have a walmart for most people you could not get to a walmart within you know 10-15 kilometers of your home so you could see that basically this business could actually if we just looked at it in north america there was a lot of room to grow and what we've seen with mcdonald's is that it our walmart is that it wasn't just a u.s story you know it was a global store so walmart has you know opened up in other countries and done well and you know we could look at other other businesses like let's say the coca-cola company you know the cocoa company was formed about a hundred and years ago and that moat is still growing after 130 years and again the unit economics are extremely attractive because the coca-cola company typically doesn't do bottling they sell the syrup so they have you know these plants which sell they do not even sell the syrup they sell syrup concentrate so basically it is almost like a software business where you know if you're if you're spending five or ten rupees on a on a coke coca-cola company might get like eight percent of that and they do not have very little cost against that so again it is it is very similar to mcdonald's in terms of in terms of economics so basically there are there are businesses different kinds of businesses you can look at a business like mastercard or visa or american express and they have similar attributes where you have very high returns on invested capital you have a very long runway and you have high integrity management inside ownership and so on so if one pursues these now you know the nature of capitalism is that everyone wants to own these kinds of businesses once these kind of moats and you know runways etc are well known the businesses get priced to perfection and they may not be available at a cheap price and so for example if we look at a business in india like dmart for example and dmart you know similar model to costco and aldi outside india and dmard is very embryonic today there is very few dmarch stores in india relative to what could possibly be their penetrations in 10 20 or 30 years but the market recognizes that and so dmr trades at you know huge multiples it doesn't appear optically cheap but the interesting thing is that if the runways are really long and they actually end up being runways that go on for you know several decades then even an expensive looking price can end up being a great value investment but but i think that as as value investors you know we have to also have a good dose of skepticism in in how we approach these things so we can not always assume that you know everything's going to go to the moon in terms of terms of size and growth and the nature of capitalism is that there will be a lot of competition that will try to go up against those modes but but i think that i think that if you know there is a there is a quote from the upanishads which goes something like this as is your wish so is your will as is your will so is your deed and as is your deed so is your destiny and then kind of the punchline is your deepest desire is your destiny so going back you know to what i started with you know if you said i want to focus on 50 cent dollar bills and that is your deepest desire you will find those if it is if you say i want 20 cent dollar bills you will find those two if you say that i only want to invest in businesses that can go up 100 times in value in 10 20 30 years you can find those too so it is a matter of what you choose to focus on and as long as you're willing to put in the work to sift through company after company you know with the framework that you're interested in so in in the case of the multibagger framework there are just three things that matter and then the fourth is the price obviously so if a business doesn't generate high returns of equity you're done you do not need to spend any time on that if the business needs a lot of debt to grow and generate higher returns and equity you would also be done you do not even need those if management quality or ethics is a question you're also done you do not need those either and so just just if you look at the businesses that generate high returns and equity that alone would wipe out large swaths of businesses and then you know you get to the runway right so dmart will be a lot larger in 10 or 15 15 years than it is today i think that is a pretty easy bet to make that the statistically i think the odds are high that something like dmart might do well we could make that statement about private sector banks in india you know private sector banks in india might be like a third of the banking pie in india today and maybe in 10 or 20 years it might be half or two thirds of the pie for example and the pie itself would have grown so there are there are things that we could hang our hat on and then kind of take it from there so basically i think that if you if you go down this path which is the multibagger path the interesting thing is that and and all all value investing there are a couple of data points you know john templeton used to say that the very best value investor or analyst will be wrong one out of three times like 33 error rate is the lowest error rate for the very best practitioner of the art if you were a kind of brain surgeon and you had even a three percent error rate there might not be too many people coming to you for brain surgery but i think in terms of value investing you could be wrong half the time and i think i've probably been wrong close to half the time and still end up with a phenomenal track record so and especially if you focus on the multibaggers you know companies that would go up 10x or 100x basically in a lifetime of investing if you end up ended up finding just two or three or four hundred baggers at the age that you're at right now that is all you need in many cases if you just found one that might be all you need and so we have all this time and on the other end we just need to find things just once do not even need to find them that many times when i started investing started my journey value investing about 27 years ago 94 95. in the first in the first five years when i was not running my funds i was just running my own money i started with about one million dollars in 95. by the time in the first five years i had had 200 baggers in the first five years itself and then i think from 2000 to 2022 now i haven't had any 100 but i think that there might be some more in the future some that are kind of you know still hopefully going through their their journey so so you do not need you do not need very many of them a few of them can get you to the promised land and i've had i would say i've had when i look back a rather sloppy journey as an investor because i was trying all these different things if i think if in 94 or 95 had done what i am telling you to do now or suggesting what you should do now i think i would have done a lot better than how i've done so if i had purely focused 10 or 100 baggers i think i think the results would be vastly better i remember in 95 january 95 when i had the one million dollars i'd mostly invested in the u.s markets but i had a interest in the indian markets as well and i thought there were two or three areas where it could do well and i decided to put 20 000 out of the one million dollars just just two percent of the portfolio into india at that time and i opened a brokerage account and so just my own monies opened nre brokerage account with kotak i decided to put half that money ten thousand dollars in one stock which was a it company and i was in the i was in the i.t services business at the time so i know i knew this business really well satyam computers which at that time actually was a pretty honest company they kind of went wayward i think in terms of their ethics about 10-12 years after that but in 95 they were a clean company so i put 10 000 to satyam and in 95 and i think by the time it was 2000 it had gone up 150x the 10 000 would become one and a half million dollars approximately 1.4 million or something and then the remaining 10 000 i put into three other stocks i bought two of the courier companies that were listed in india at the time blue dart and skypac courier because my perspective was that the indian postal service was just host and if you really wanted to get a package from point a to point b in india you really had to rely on private people to get it for you i do not think the postal service was reliable and so i thought that these businesses that were focused on that would do quite well so i was just going to make three investments actually half and satyam and then half in these other two and then at the last minute i was also very impressed with kotak because i was just very impressed in dealing with their people and so i decided to split the other ten thousand three ways you know one about thirty two thirty three hundred in kotak and thirty three hundred to the other two businesses so when this 10 000 became 1.4 million or whatever in 2000 the other three businesses had done nothing for five years it was pretty much sitting close to what i had paid for them like no movement for the most part it is not realistic to think that if you put 20 000 in the indian market and you get you know 1.4 million something like a 70x that you there is still some meat on that bone and there is stint some juice to be extracted if you will so i said this is a pretty good result and for no really good reason in 2000 i sold the other three stocks and i told kotak you know sell these stocks and just send me the money back i basically liquidated the entire indian portfolio in 2000. there was no there was no really good reason to sell blue dart or skype or kota no particular reason that i had to do that kotak from 2000 till now is about a 500x blue dot is about a 300 x sky pack went kind of backwards i think eventually went bankrupt but it was down like 90 or something so basically there were massive home runs there were two massive home runs which like i said i there was no reason to kind of make that decision to sell but that is what happened and you know i missed those two rides but even with these sloppy nature and kind of stupid analysis that i did in those cell decisions the end result was fine and the remaining 980 000 that had invested in the us over the next four five years by 99 2000 it was about 13 million or so so that had gone up quite a bit because one of those one of those bets had gone up 100 x 100 000 became about 10 million or so so anyway the thing is that even with a lot of sloppiness what i'm saying is that basically what what when you look at that investing that took place then just the two bets that were 100 bagger were responsible for like 80 90 of the returns it didn't matter the rest didn't matter if it all went to zero the results were still been great and so that is the nature of this multi-bagger type investing is that it can tolerate a very high error rate and of course your your objective as an analyst should be to try to keep the error rate as low as possible in 2019 i was visiting istanbul for the second time and turkish market actually i think is the cheapest market in the world because they've got just a lot of crazy macro things going on in the country very high inflation and weird policies and everyone's exited and so on in fact turkey reminds me of the indian markets maybe in the early 90s or so on and i ran into this business on my second trip in 2019 where the market cap was 20 million dollars and the liquidation value was more than six or seven hundred million dollars it was actually a dollar bill trading for three cents which i do not think it never happened to me before then so in the previous 24 years of investing that never happened and i think till i leave planet hurt i do not think it will happen again but basically you know if i look at this business which i bought at you know three cents on the dollar like the 20 million market cap i i was surprised with the volumes obry funds owns one third of that business and we pretty much got one third of the business for like eight million dollars or something if the business did not increase in value at all but it got to fair value at some point we would have a 30x return 30 or 33x or something but now we want the business for what three years they've actually increased value of the business quite a bit in the last three years and it is run by phenomenal people really good capital allocators and i think they will increase the value of the business quite significantly in the years ahead so having learned my lesson from kotak and blue dart and so on the only thing i need to do with this business is do nothing just sit there and spend time talking to students like you so that the time is used up and not used to sell things hopefully 20 years from now we still own that business so if that business tripled in what it is worth the value like you know was 600 billion million or something let's say it became 2 billion we would have 100 and i think it can it can triple its value in maybe five or ten years and it can keep going after that i mean the the two people running it they're not that old so i think they could they could keep compounding for a while and so when i look at kind of that particular business and it is it is a small part of the portfolio today it is gone up i think in the last three years it is gone up like five six x or so so it is gradually moving towards its its value and so on but i'm just saying that the nature of these hundred daggers is that this one business could become bigger than everything else in the portfolio even though we made such a small bet with it so with that i think i'll stop there would love to hear what you have on your mind we can talk about what i just talked about or stuff that isn't related so thank you thank you sir for the insightful session it was so interesting to listen listen to you now we will open the flow for questions from the audience those who want to ask that question can raise their hand okay sonia you may go first okay thank you for this insightful session so in this today we always listen a lot that the value of anything is added in the modern world so what is your opinion on this well you know all intelligent investing is value investing because we have so many stocks around the world and because there are so many things going on with different companies around the world that you know like this news anchor jim cramer says there is a bull always a bull market somewhere so i think that if one is a investment analyst and you know picks through stuff you will you will find that there are some parts of the markets and some parts of the of the ecosystem that is appears very overvalued but you'll also find that there is lots of things that are hated and unloved and like for example you know turkey is hated and unloved so there are always in in it is in the nature of auction driven markets that they will overshoot and undershoot i mean one one simple data point you can look at is look at the price of any stock on the nsc or bse and look at the 52-week range on that stock you know it might be 50 to 150 or 100 to 200 or 500 to 1000. it is a like a 50 100 swing in one year for almost every stock like all 5000 stocks right but if you look at for example the cost of an apartment in mumbai for example you know apartment in bandra or some place and you have a friend who's a broker or an agent and you go to him every day and say what is my flat word he'll say your flat is worth three crores and then you go to him the next day and say what is my flat work now he'll say it is still three crores and then you go to him after one week and you ask him again what is my flat word he'll say listen idiot it is still three crores and you keep bothering this guy every day and then maybe after three months he might say you know it is actually 3.1 crores you know it has moved a little bit 3.1 crore now i can get you 3.1 crores and then maybe in six months or eight months if you keep bothering him and he's still your friend every day maybe it becomes three point three crores you know in a year or something okay possible maybe three and a half or might go to two and a half you know the fluctuation rate of that flat is not going to range between three and six crores in a year it is going to be like 2.7 to 3.3 crore in a very tight band because that price is not being set in an auction format it is being set with an intelligent buyer facing an intelligent seller and when you have intelligent buyers facing intelligence sellers you get great practice price discovery but when you have these you know auction driven markets which is the nsc or bse or new york stock exchange you will get much wider swings and so if you're in a in in the business of investing where you are dealing with auction driven markets just this phenomena of the 50 swing means at some point the stock is mispriced it has to be at one it has to be either under price at some point overpriced at some point because the real value of the business cannot change 50 in a year for most businesses so hence we have proved that there is always value in investments and markets thank you sir okay we you can ask a question thanks for the like my question is essentially around specifically to india we have a lot of corporate governance issues within india so when you are picking companies how are you filtering out these companies which have significant corporate governance issues which an hour later for example that had massive issues later on so what kind of filters do you use when you are investing or picking i think that your filters need to be stronger investing in india than i would have in the us i think that if i were to invest only in the new york stock exchange type businesses the odds that i would lose money because of fraud approaches zero you know i would say if i make 10 investments all in the new york exchange and i have a lifetime of investing i do just in that market maybe out of you know 50 investments i make in a 40-50 year period at the most one might be fraudulent something like that it would be pretty low number in india if i did the same thing i think the number would be higher but i think the that given that we already know that that the ethos levels of let's say managers or managements in india may be somewhat lower than the ethos level of a typical nyc comp listed company we can adjust for that so there are plenty of businesses in india where one can reach a fairly decent conclusion that the ethics and ethos of the business and the owners is high and there may be a lot of businesses where we may not be able to make that determination so if we either know that ethics is low or governance has issues or we're not able to figure it out you just take a pass on those businesses just like you would take a pass on a low return equity business you know it could be very ethical but return equity is low because there is 5 000 listed companies you still end up in a decent universe to look at so i think i think if you if you set up rigorous filters for ethics it may not be foolproof but you can reduce the error rate okay but you can ask your question thank you for your great session myself my question is that how what is your strategy in identifying and valuing a company and how do you identify your first talk is overvalued or undervalued i think that if a business is within your circle of competence i mean let's let's take the example of a business like dmart for example and let's say i have not looked at dmart recently but let's say for example a trailing pe basis is trading at 100 times earnings which you know it used to trade it or maybe still trading it something like that if one understood the business and one had a good view of what the cash flows of the business are over the next 10 or 20 years you can discount those cash flows back and then that would tell you whether the business is overvalued or undervalued it would just be a straight math exercise so and if you are not able to estimate those cash flows then i think there is no basis on which you could make an investment like that so you would take a pass in that particular case the first question to ask yourself is do i understand the business and is the business within my circle of competence and if you understand the business and the business is within your circle of competence then by definition you know with some boundaries what the future of the business is likely to look like and what the trajectory is like to look at what the cash flows are like likely to look like and i think if you can put some boundaries around that then you have a basis to make an investment in in 2015 an indian guy living in vancouver canada his name is parry pasricha he had sent me i didn't know him he sent me a write-up of a company based in hyderabad called rain industries and basically at that time you know the extremely well-written write-up like 20-page pdf it is actually i think that write-up is floating on the internet so i think if you if you just google like very persuasion industry probably that pdf will pull up there is another guy luca franca who had done a report on reign and i think that is also in the internet somewhere that was done before perry did his report but basically the situation that perry was bringing up in that report was that rain was trading at i think 35 rupees a share at that time about a you know 170 or 180 million market cap at that time with about two billion dollars in revenue it was trading at about one tenth of sales the price to sales ratio was 0.1 it seemed very likely that in the next four or five years in a single year rain's earnings would be over 35 rupees a share so when i looked at rain it is a very cyclical business it has a lot of gyrations a lot of issues with it but it was extremely cheap in effect it was trading at a future peo one i couldn't find anything wrong with it so i made i made a bet on rain industries and as a foreign investor we could only buy 9.99 and so we bought 9.99 percent of the business for i think 20 million dollars by less than three years after we bought in early 2018 late 2017 it was trading at over 400 rupees a share so my my thesis when i originally invested was that i think i thought i just want to own this business when the earnings are 35 rupees and i just want to see what the market would do with the price of the stock when the earnings are 35 rupees a share i just want to see if it actually sits at 35 rupees at that point and which i didn't think was possible but i just wanted to see what happened so this was just a pure math game and of course when the earnings i think their earnings were coming to close to 10 rupees a quarter when they were approaching 9 or 10 rupees a quarter the stock went to like 440 rupees and of course by that time i had fallen madly in love with rain and it is great management and they're very high ethics and very very honest competent operators i said no this is a this is a far better business than i thought it is and you know we shouldn't get off the bus so quickly you know all most of the time i probably didn't get off the bus too quickly so rain went from 35 rupees in 2015 to 440 rupees in early 2018 to 60 rupees in march of 2020 when covet hit to about 160 or 170 rupees currently okay and we still own it right but even if you take the current situation you know with a 160 or something in in rupees it is like a 4x in seven years for example and you know we think it'll do better and be worth more in the future so i think in that case you know like i said it is it is like we i couldn't i do not i still do not have a crystal ball on reign of what next 10 years of cash flows would be that is i think impossible to estimate but i think the fact that we would make money on that investment was a very high probability certain in public auction markets my question digresses a bit it is for the private markets venture capital in particular i want to understand what parameters will you employ for investing in early stage startups from a value investing lens in the context of a where price discovery as you mentioned is ambiguous b given the current news of funding winter and the capital drying up yeah i mean i think that i'm probably not the right person to ask that question to i think the the closer you go towards the formation date of a business and then try to extrapolate the future of that business the more murky it becomes so the the venture capital game is a very different game in the sense that you are expecting most of your returns to come from one or two bets in the fund for example and you're expecting 80 90 of the fund may a lot of those investments may go by the wayside or may not do much long term so basically it is a very different game i think it is very hard to get downside protection in the venture game and i think it is very hard to do these future cash flow projections and all of that because we just do not have the trademarks we do not have the the historical trend mark so it is it is not something that i think i have expertise and the other thing about the venture business is that if we look at the statistics you know so in in silicon valley which has had a very long history of venture capital the venture funds that have let's say the top 10 percent you know their annualized returns and the top 10 percent of venture funds their returns are multiples of so you know the top quartile funds have done much much better than the bottom quartile funds and if you do the same thing with bond funds for example the difference between a top quartile bond fund and a bottom quartile bond fund may be almost non-existent might be like 100 basis points or 200 basis points would be a very very small difference so what i'm saying is that the ability to add alpha in a bond fund is very limited and if we if we look at a if we look at a fund like you know sequoyah fund or andreessen aurovitz or y combinator etc they have an advantage they have multiple advantages but one of the big advantages they have is deal flow so i have some friends and you know some of my investors are venture capitalists in silicon valley they say to me that if we had access to the trash can of sequoia our returns would be 3x what they are so if he said if we could just look at every deal that sequoia turned down we would do 3x better because they said we just do not get to see you know so deal flow so one of the one of the things about the public markets is the small investor actually has a huge advantage over the institutional investor an institutional investor with you know hundreds of millions or billions of dollars cannot look at small investments they just they have to put large amounts of money to work at a time a small investor having you know five crores to invest or 50 lakhs to invest 10 lakhs to invest can look at everything you can look at nano caps can look at everything and so their universe is much wider and they can be a lot more picky in terms of where they put their money so in the public markets the small investor has a huge advantage in the venture market a small investor or an unknown investor with no no access to real deal flow is at a huge disadvantage so my conclusion when i look at all of that is it is not a game where the odds are in my favor and so i have chosen not to play in that area and i think the kinds of questions you're asking i think are very difficult questions to answer thank you in the interest of time we will take only last two questions beyonce you may go you may go you can go first i do not know if the others can hear you or not but i can barely hear you but okay go ahead will try i put my question in the chat box if that will happen yeah i think i think for a know nothing investor passive index investing is a great way to go especially if you have you know many decades of time and you're young and so on i think index investing does well the frictional costs are low and such if you have a view and you understand certain businesses you understand they're undervalued and and so on then i think you could actually you know pick stocks and so on but i would say starting baseline being a passive investor is certainly a great way to go for most people next sure thank you thank you sir for an insightful session so my question is very simple so when we look at value investing which was being propagated by say the likes of ben graham we did not have the modern situation right and a of a negative usual reach for a longer period of time but then liquidity both absolute and relative so do you think that probably sticking to that value investing may result in risking probably figuring out who the future winners could be or simply put probably what would you change in value investing which has been taught or which has been learned to something which would be more relevant in a current context yeah i think it is a good question so i think that most investors would be better off completely ignored everything macro so for example if if i had a viewpoint of kind of what would happen to starbucks 20 years ago it really doesn't matter what the rates are and the fed is doing and what you know what financial crisis is happening or whatever else has happened at the core the starbucks business is such that when they open a store in the u.s they get their money back in two years 35 return on capital they do not franchise any stores and when they open a store in china they get their money back in 15 months like something like 70 return on capital and i mean they have found for example that if they have one store in manhattan in a particular intersection and they put another store diagonal from that store it doesn't even cannibalize the first store when the second store is so close and such so it is an it is an incredible business so i think that if one focuses on understanding the business and is able to identify great businesses that should be where the focus is when i made the investment in turkey in this in this business it was completely irrelevant to me what was happening on the macro front i mean turkey inflation rates are crazy and the way they deal with the currency is crazy but i was i could look at that business and see that these things would not really matter in terms of our returns and basically when i made the investment in that business one dollar was five lira you know five leader could get you one dollar now it is almost 18 lira to get one dollar so i have suffered incredible devaluation but in dollar terms we are up for x in lira terms we are up infinite x but who cares about that so what i'm saying is that we had extreme headwinds macro headwinds when we went in didn't care about it and it didn't matter so i think it is it is very important to be right on the business if you were early on mcdonald's and walmart or any of these you know mastercard visa whatever coke and so on i think the thing is that you know some of these you know long runways they will transcend everything that is the key is can you find these great businesses can you find them early enough can you buy them at decent prices and then can you be patient through thick and thin sure that is that is why there is a there is a investment bank in nariman point enam most of you will be familiar with imam you know they took infosys public and when they took infosys public they were having difficulty placing the stock you know they were the underwriter they were left with stock that nobody was willing to buy enam kept the stock for themselves until pretty recently they kept most of those shares i think they may have they may have reduced or eliminated the position now or it is a small much smaller position but basically it doesn't matter what else inarm did in the last 30 years it is irrelevant what they did in the last 30 years 90 percent of the value of that firm was based on whether or not they kept that infosys stock that nobody wanted and so it is a good business they're great people and they're smart people but one decision you know trumps all the other decisions and if they had sold infosys or they had found a lot of people willing to buy it i think inam would be a shadow of itself where it is today so you know it is just small small things like that create huge deltas in where things end up thank you thank you so much sir sir can we take up one last question by pawn if time permits you of course yes but when you can ask your question thank you so much sir and thanks a lot for your wisdom sir today so my question is regarding multibaggers as we discussed so during our holding period of say 10 15 20 odd years we see drawdowns of over north of like 50 percent sometimes even 90 percent during the 10 year investment 10 years so how do you deal with that situation and it often arises when you are holding for such a long period of time especially for multivitamins yeah so conviction is really important and how do you get conviction i mean i think i think you get conviction because you have a very strong understanding of the business so if i if i go back to the business in turkey for example basically you know that business has a number of different business lines but the one that has the most value today is they have 12 million square feet of prime warehouse space in turkey it is mostly in istanbul and that 12 million square feet has a value today you know you could go to a broker he will tell you that you can sell the whole thing and you will probably get a billion dollars for it something like that billion billion two or something there is only about 100 million 80 million of debt so if you just liquidate that entire position you'll get about maybe 900 million dollars or something and you know so what is the warehouse so warehouse is land concrete steel some 20 is refrigerated so you have some refrigerated units and all that all of these things are going to increase in value if you have inflation so steel price is going to go up because it is going to it is going to track international steel prices concrete and cement prices will track international concrete and ceramic prices and land also has prime land and a prime you know major city in the world has a value and so when i invested the value per square foot was about eighty dollars a square foot for land and improvements and i do not think that 80 is going anywhere you know it it may be 200 a square foot at some point but it will not go to 30 square foot that will not happen so so i do not care about anything else that is going on that is the piece that is the most important it is 99 lease it is 10 years inflation index leases and all of that so conviction is really important right so if you if you invested in starbucks you would have two or three things that you understand you would understand the unit economics that when they open a store they get their money back in one or two years you would understand that if that suddenly changed where it was taking five years or ten years to get your money back when you open a new store something has changed right that is a significant change if that looks like a secular permanent change the thesis has changed but if you if it continues to be very high returns on capital the second is you would have had some perspective on the runway where you say okay it has 5000 stores around the world for example it probably has more than that right now but at 20 years from now i think it can easily be 25 000 stores for example and if you have conviction on that then you know you the two pieces that really matter is that what are the unit economics and what is the store count you know and those are really the pieces that matter and so when you make an investment in a stock you should be able to explain the thesis of that investor investment in five or ten sentences to a ten-year-old without a spreadsheet and without anything okay and this is why this makes sense and that gives you the conviction if you have to go look at a spreadsheet or look at something to then you know when price drop 50 to understand what is going on you have not done your homework so it needs to get down when you've done all the work to simplicity you know it can take a long time to get to those essence of these businesses but it needs to get to the essence of those businesses so you have to get to understanding why is this business resilient why will it be around 10 years from now and why will the economics and the return on equity and all of that still be high why will all those things be true so we aren't particularly concerned with price movements we are concerned with the expansion or shrinkage of the moon if the mote goes through a secular decline we have a problem the quoted price changing is not relevant sir thank you so much thank you so much sir for your insights before we conclude this amazing session sbm nmims would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to mr monis fabry for sparing his valuable time to grace this event and enlighten us with some really practical practical and usable words of wisdom we would also like to extend our gratitude to all the attendees for their unabated attention to our event and for some really good questions we definitely have something to take back home what was more intriguing for us was how you identify stocks whether it is through chalk acres three-legged stool which can become multibagger for example mcdonald's coca-cola etc and i'm very sure if we replicate this approach we can make money for ourselves if knowledge is power then curiosity is the muscle

All right. Anyway, it is a pleasure and a honour to be invited back to be with
you. I have always find the students at Peking University as the best of any
students I interact with anywhere in the world. It is an amazing group of
people. I am honoured and humbled to be with this August audience, and I
am also very excited to continue the interaction and dialogue. I think this is
the fourth time we have had different venues and including once in Irvine
and once in Beijing, and a couple of times now online. Anyway, what I
wanted to do was that, I wanted to share a few slides and thoughts with you
and then we can open up to questions and we can talk about what I have
just presented, or we can talk about whatever you would like to speak on.
The thing is that, when I look back at my life and journey as a value investor,
there are two years that stand out in terms of being a very significant step
function, in terms of the learning and growth I went through. The first time
that happened was in 1994, which is about 26 years ago. When I heard about
Warren Buffett for the first time, and I had never been in the investing
business, or never even really, I might have bought a stock here and there,
but really didn't understand investing. I was taken and surprised by Buffett's
approach to investing to the point that, in the next few years, I shifted
completely to becoming an investor. I am an engineer by training, and I was
running an IT services company. In a few years, I made the switch
completely to a full-time investor. 1994 was a year of tremendous learning
and growth for me and it was really helpful. Then, the second time I went
through a step function of growth was this year in 2020. For most people,
year 2020, they like to forget and move on because of the pandemic and all 

the issues we have had with shutdowns and all the fatalities and health
issues and so on. Maybe, it was because of all the time at home. I am not
sure. But I found that I went through another renaissance this year, and I
wish I had gone through this second renaissance many years ago. But, I
think Charlie Munger says, ‘we are old too soon, and why is too late but it’s
better late than never’. I want to talk about one aspect of the renaissance
that I went through, and it is changing my approach to investing quite
significantly, a lot of these things will appear very obvious to you. Some of
us, like me, are not that smart, it maybe not so obvious, but let me share
these with you, and then we can talk about it. If you are an investor, a value
investor, really at the highest level, you have got kind of two kinds of options
in terms of the businesses you can invest in. You can invest in what I would
call growing pies, these are businesses that have strong growth ahead of
them. They have got long runways, and these businesses can get pretty
large. One can do quite well investing in growing pies, even if one is paying
what might appear to be an optically expensive price and there are many
advantages to being an investor in growing pies. You can set it and forget it.
This is really one of the only ways you can get to really strong multi-bagger
returns, maybe 10 times your money or a hundred times your money.
Growing pies is definitely a great way to go. The second way to invest is
discounted pies and discounted 50-cent dollars bills or 40 cent dollar bills.
Here you are on a treadmill of activity because you have to buy and sell.
Then again buy, and again sell and keep doing that in taxable accounts. It
can be tax inefficient, and it is difficult to get more than a double or triple,
because if you bought a company at 50% off and it did not grow, and you
were correct about it, then maybe you will double your money when that
valuation gap closes. Maybe even if it gets some growth, you might get
three times your money or something, but it is hard to get more than that.
When I started as an investor in 94, having just heard about Buffett and so
on, I was focused on growing pies. The period from 94 to about 99, 2000
was a period of very strong stock market returns in the US. It eventually kind
of peaked with a very massive bubble, the dollar bubble of 2000. Then of
course, the NASDAQ index crashed and burned. It dropped about 80%, and
even the S&P had a very long period of no returns. I could see by 98, 99 that
things were getting frosty. I had done really well in that period. In fact, I
captured 200 bagger in that period. I was an individual investor at the time.
I was not running a fund, but then I got concerned around late 99, that this
party at some point will end and it will probably end badly. The market was
really interesting at that time because there were a set of companies that
were very overvalued but there was another whole set of businesses that
were not sexy businesses, which were very modestly priced and even
maybe severely under-priced. One could actually make investments in
those businesses. For example, in 2000, the day the NASDAQ peaked, I think
March 6th or March 9th, 2000, was the same day that Berkshire Hathaway
hit a multi-year low in stock price. I think the Berkshire stock price at that
time got down to about 40,000. It was literally that people were pulling
money out of Berkshire Hathaway and putting it into pets.com or
chemdex.com, all these different kinds of euphoric eToys and all these
things that were going on at the time. I switched in the early two thousand
from investing in growing pies to focusing on discounted pies, because I
thought the index would give me a lot of headwinds, and, traditionally,
growing pies were quite overheated and such. What I should have done
probably maybe a few years back, maybe three or four years ago, five years 

ago, was, I should have switched back because we did extremely well with
discounted pies in the funds. Because the NASDAQ was flat from 2000 to
2016. It basically went nowhere. In fact, it went down quite a bit before it
got back to the same 2000 level. The S&P 500 was flat till about 2012. They
took a long time to get back to their previous highs. Obviously, the better
way to invest between these two is growing pies. But you also need to keep
in mind a little bit about where the market and the index is at, where you
are not kind of getting to euphoric, if you will. If you look at this path to 10,
200 baggers, there could be more, but there are basically five ways you
could get there, right? One is, you could buy these, what I would call focused
mouse straps. These are very narrowly focused players with long runways
like Moutai in China, which just opened its first store in China, McDonald's
and so on. You could also get there with great capital allocators, kind of like
Berkshire Hathaway or Danaher or Exor, which is based in Europe. Or you
could also get there by investing in Uber cannibals. Uber cannibals are
companies that are very focused on stock buybacks, and they end up buying
back large portions. For example, a company like NVR, which is a US-based
home builder since 1996, and started doing stock buybacks until now 2020,
they bought back something like 82% of their shares outstanding. Just 18%
of the shares outstanding are left and NVR has delivered, I think more than
70 baggers. In that period, the stock has gone up more than 70 times. In fact
in the last 20 years, it has gone up more than 55 times, and the business
actually has not grown that much. All they have done is, they have taken all
their free cash flow every year and pounded it into buybacks. AutoZone is
another one. These are not rapidly growing businesses. But again, similar
story. Then one that happened in the sixties and seventies was Teledyne
with Henry Singleton. In fact, there is a book that you might enjoy called
Distant Force. Teledyne issued a lot of stock in the 1960s when it acquired
almost 150 businesses when the market gave it a very high multiple. Then in
the 1970s when the US equity markets were very cheap and collapsed,
Teledyne was trading at, maybe single digit multiple of earnings, Henry
Singleton bought back more than 80% of the stock. Again, in the case of
Teledyne, they delivered about 125 times the value from 1960 to 1980, it was
about 125 x. Then you can also get to multi baggers by buying, deeply
undervalued players, companies that have gone down a lot. I have done
some of that. These are some companies I have invested in. Teck Cominco
was one I bought, During the financial crisis in 09, it became a 10 bagger.
Fiat Chrysler in 2012, which also did very well. Then great industries more
recently. But the one I want to talk about today, which is part of the
Renaissance this year, is the “spawners” and the “spawners” are companies
that continuously spawned related and unrelated businesses. Very few
companies have the DNA to be great spawners. We will drill down a little bit
on the different kinds of spawners. Basically, these are companies that have
a deep conviction of, and really it is part of the DNA to keep adding and
incubating new businesses that have the potential to be massive growth
engines. They expect many of these things to fail, and they take failure in
stride. A good example is the Bezos quote. “if they are staying in day one
requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect
saplings, and double down when you see customer delight”. Amazon is one
of the great spawner companies that we have. Spawning also has a lot of
advantages, in fact, a lot more advantages than cannibals, because
cannibals have to pay tax on their earnings, and then they can use the
money to buy back shares. In the case of spawning, what you are doing is, 

you are basically reducing your net income, which basically then reduces
your taxes. In effect, you are getting an interest free loan from the
government on very easy terms, payable when able. For example, through
most of its history, Amazon has hardly reported much in earnings. Their core
business was quite profitable, but they were taking all the cash flows and
continuously investing them into new bets. 30-40% of the money that they
were investing would have gone to the government if they didn't do that. It
is a very capital-efficient way to do this if you are good at spawning. There
are different kinds of spawners, and I came up with these different
spawners on my own, they may be more, but I think this captures a lot of it.
Adjacent spawners are companies that create businesses that are close to
the business they are already on in, like Amazon, when they started they
were only selling books, and then they started adding more categories. They
started selling music, and they kept adding more categories. It didn't require
a lot of change in the business. That is what I would call adjacent spawners.
Embryonic spawners are companies that acquire businesses and then
nurture them into much larger enterprises. For example, through most of its
history, Microsoft has not been an acquisitive company. It basically kind of
grew its businesses organically, but they bought what we know as
PowerPoint as they actually bought the company, and then they changed
the name to PowerPoint and then made it part of office. That was the
example of an embryonic spawner. Cloner spawners are not innovative.
They just copy successful products. Microsoft is a good example of cloner
spawners and then non-adjacent spawners creator or buying new unrelated
business areas. For example, recently during the pandemic, BYD went into
the manufacturing of N95 masks. That business has nothing to do with what
one would consider the core competencies of BYD but Chuan Fu Wang has
never been limited by core competencies. He has repeatedly gone into
businesses. When you would look at him from the outside, you would say,
he has no competence in this, but he has repeatedly shown that he can get
competent. They entered the car business, and they were able to make that
quite a success, which is difficult. They entered the N95 mass business, and
I am pretty sure if they haven't already turned business, they will. Then Apex
Spawner is a business that uses all four of these strategies and such.
Generally speaking, the reason I am giving you these categories is, Apex
spawners are very rare, and Apex spawners can be amongst the very best
investments you can make because they have got so many different ways
to Nirvana. It's kind of a Swiss Army knife. They can bring out different tools
and they are really good at all of the above. Let us look at some of these
spawners with some examples. Adjacent spawns, we can look at Starbucks.
They created the consumer packet good, the Frappuccino bottles, which
first they did a deal with Pepsi, which they sold in supermarkets. They
created a coffee machine. I think now in China, they have opened the
Starbucks Reserve stores, which have done really well. They are also
experimenting with alcohol-infused drinks and such, which is quite a
significant departure from what is traditionally a Starbucks store. But they
are doing all these spawns and it extends the runway. Facebook has been
really good at embryonic spawning where they bought Instagram, and they
bought WhatsApp. They bought Oculus, and they have taken these
embryonic businesses, and they have created pretty significant value and
growth. The same with what Google did with YouTube. Very significant grid
or what Google did with Android, which is also a company they bought.
Microsoft doesn't do much embryonic spawning, but like I told you, they 

bought a company named Forethought and then later renamed it as
PowerPoint. But they are very good at cloner spawning windows, the Mac,
Word and Excel from Word Perfect and Lotus, Explorer from Netscape,
surface from the iPod, Azure, from Google, and Amazon web services and
Teams from Slate and such Apex spawners I told you, they are very rare. If
you can spot a apex spawner early in its journey, it can be very attractive
and can give you a pretty long runway. Because what happens is, Amazon
started with just a bookstore, it is like all eggs in one basket. But as they
start doing more things, because these are mostly digital bets, the return on
capital is extremely high. It can also tolerate all of failure. They have done a
very good job with obviously the adjacent spawning, embryonic spawning,
like they bought Zappos and Whole Foods. Cloner you know, some of these
cloners didn't work. Like they came up with a fire phone, which they offered
for I think 99 cents. But they couldn't get any traction. Then the fire phone
was buried and they moved on. Then they have done non-adjacent
spawning, like Amazon Web Services is quite a departure from their typical
retail, and it is done very well. Kindle was quite a departure because it
required quite a few different competencies. Similarly, Alphabet has done
all of the above. They have done a lot of embryonic stuff. They have also
done a lot of non-adjacent stuff where they have gone into things like
Google Fiber and so on. Alibaba, you guys are very familiar with, Alipay,
which is the adjacent spawning. They have done a number of things on the
embryonic front, cloners, and then even the non-adjacent with the Alibaba
Cloud and Alitrip. Berkshire Hathaway, the insurance was a spawn that Ajit
Jain did for them. Probably worth over a hundred billion in value that, that
business has created for Berkshire from scratch, where they pretty much
didn't have to put up a lot of risk capital to make that happen. For
embryonic, they bought GEICO and it had been around for a long time, but
it was pretty small, less than 2% market share of the US insurance business.
Now it is more than 10%. Mid-American Energy has grown a lot. Nebraska
Furniture Mart has grown a lot. They have started some digital insurance
companies recently, three insurance and BiBerk, these are cutting out the
agent. They have cloned some of the other players like, I think Wilco and so
on. Then Tencent, again has done a number of things on all of the above.
You guys use WeChat, the games, Future mobility, and Baidu is very similar.
They have kind of done all of the above. These have been tremendous home
runs, especially if you have got them early. One spawner I just want to talk
about is Kotak Mahindra, a company in India. I actually was smart enough
to make a very small investment in this company in 1995 and I was also very
dumb where I sold the company in 2000 with almost no returns. I will come
back to this slide in a second, but I just want to show you kind of what
happened with Kotak. In 1995, I invested a small amount of money in India,
maybe around $25,000. Personally, I was going to invest in three businesses
in India at the time, which I thought they all had huge runways. Kotak was
actually my broker that had opened the account in dealing with them. I was
just really impressed with the quality of the people I was dealing with. Pretty
much at the last minute, I said, “out of this 25,000, I will put 3000 or so into
Kotak because they were listed company and such”. What happened with
my 25,000 investment is, one company that I would invest about 10,000 in
was 140 X. It became 1.4 million in about five years. I was smart enough to
exit that, I was part of the dotcom boom. Then I thought, the other three
companies had not done much over that period of time. I said, “Okay, you
hit the big time it won. It doesn't really matter for no good reason, really”. I 

sold the other three companies at 2000, including Kotak. Of course, if I had
just kept the 3000 dollars in Kotak, I would have about 600,000 today. But
just to go back to Kotak, they were a very small broker. Goldman Sachs at
the time had taken a 20% stake in them, because again, I think, like me, they
were very impressed with them. The key thing that happened to them was
in 2003, in 2003, they got a banking license. In India, it is really hard to get
banking licenses. I mean, the Reserve Bank has issued very few banking
licenses to private banks, and Kotak today has become one of the largest
private banks in India. They have executed really well, and that is where the
bulk of their upside has come from. But the company has spawned many
adjacent businesses, and they have acquired a few businesses and gone
from there. I told you, most companies do not have the DNA to do
spawning. Spawning is an unusual kind of DNA, especially successful
spawners. For example, some of you may be familiar with Chipotle, which is
a very successful Mexican chain here in the US. I don't think they have
entered China yet, but McDonald's actually spotted Chipotle when they just
had about 20 or 30 stores in Denver, in Colorado. I think they took a 20 or
30% stake in Chipotle and then later McDonald's felt that it was a distraction
for them to own this business. Chipotle had grown a lot. It had gone from
20, 30 stores to a few hundred stores. McDonald’s had done really well with
the investment. They could clearly see that, there was a long runway ahead,
but they felt it was a distraction. They divested that stake and of course,
Chipotle has been a major home run for them, so McDonald's is kind of a
company where they, from a DNA perspective, are all in on the McDonald's
brand, and they have innovated inside McDonald's. For example, breakfast
was an innovation, drive through was an innovation, the Big Mac was a big
innovation, the McMuffin and most of these innovations came from their
franchisees, but McDonald's basically, you can say the opposite of Alibaba
or an Amazon. They don't do very well having multiple brands or businesses.
They just want to be all in on McDonald's and do that really well, and that
works well for them. They are classically a non-spawner. Another one is
Ford. Ford had, many years ago, invested and bought Land Rover and
Jaguar, and then when Alan Mulally came in as a CEO, he felt traction
because he noticed that most of the Ford executives were driving Land
Rovers and Jaguars and not really driving Ford cars because they were
getting employed discounts on all the brands. He really wanted to focus
only on the Ford brand. In 2009, he got rid of these two companies, and
actually they are decent companies. They have very strong brands built
over, probably, close to a century or more. Most businesses are not good at
spawning. In fact, these are two examples of businesses that actually got
rid of what would have been adjacent businesses just because they felt it
was a distraction. Some other examples of Non-spawners, Costco is a great
example of a non-spawners. It executes really well. I mean, if you compare
Costco to Walmart, Walmart has spawned quite a bit. They have a number
of formats of stores and operations globally, and they have a number of
formats even in the US. Moutai is also, you can say, very singularly focused
in and around the core of Moutai brand and such. One of the things that
spawning does, which makes it very good from an investing point of view,
is, capitalism is very brutal. Every company is eventually going to die. It is
just the nature of capitalism. Even for the strongest businesses, there will
come a time when Alibaba will not be around. Amazon will not be around
because if you just study the history of businesses that were dominant 50
years ago, a hundred years ago, they are not with us today. GE and IBM were 

good, strong Spawners. If they had not done spawning, they would have
died a long time ago. Spawning extended the runway of these companies.
Microsoft originally was just making compilers. They had a basic compiler,
they were a compiler company. From there, they went into becoming an
operating system company. They actually bought the company that
became MS-DOS. It would just be a shadow itself without spawning,
because all these things that they have done is all add on to the core
business. Spawning basically keeps the mothership young and healthy. It
has a lot of advantages, including, I already told you about tax advantages.
Some rules on spawning investing is that, you can probably study these
statistics in China, but if I look at the United States in the last 20 years, there
were 3700 IPOs in the US. Only nine businesses with an IPO in the last 20
years have exceeded a hundred million market cap, now. If you just make a
simple assumption that a business that you invest in will never get to more
than a 50 billion market cap, if you just made that assumption, then by
inversion, you get a couple of rules. If you want a 10 bagger, 10 times your
money out of a business, it means you can't really buy a business which is
more than a 5 billion market cap. If you want to buy a hundred bagger, then
you really can't buy a business that has more than a 500 billion market cap.
The important thing with these hundred baggers and 10 baggers. If you look
at any public company, or most public companies, pretty much around the
world, almost all of them have been hundred baggers. At some point, most
of the hundred baggers is usually captured while they were still private.
Once they come public, they may not be small enough where they can go a
hundred times. But the earlier you can get to these businesses, the more
likely it is that you can get to 10 times your money or a hundred times your
money. If we look at a business like Alibaba today, it has 800 billion market
value, can Alibaba be a hundred bagger in 20 years? Anything is possible,
but it is probably unlikely because you are talking about something like 80
trillion dollars. It is a really large number and we don't even have businesses
anywhere in the world that are more than $3 trillion. Even much more than
$2 trillion. Catching multi-bagger early is important, but also you have to
remember that the earlier you go in a company's life, the wider the range of
outcomes. If I invest in Moutai today, the path is relatively narrow in terms
of outcomes, but if I go into a very early stage business, the range can be
quite wide. There is an art and science here in terms of making sure you
have enough fractions. What I call the Pabrai’s spawning rules, which I just
came up with a few days ago is, make an assumption that no business you
invest in will ever exceed a 50 billion market cap. If you want to make 10
times your money, you go buy below 5 billion. If you want to make more
than hundred times your money, you go buy below 500 million. What I
found about spawning is that, spawning is not a trait that you can easily
screen for automatically. You can run a screen for low PE, you can run a
screen for low price to book, and you can run a screen for a lot of
quantitative metrics about a company. It is generally, at least from what I
have found, it is not obvious what business is a spawner or is not a spawner
until you spend at least a little bit of time looking at the business. Once you
look at the business with a little bit of more detail, then you can get to the
nature of the spawning. Are they a non-spawner or are they a spawner? If
they are a spawner, stronger spawner, are they okay? Does it have strong
spawning DNA or not? One of the things I want to get to in my portfolio
eventually is a portfolio that is only spawners and ideally a portfolio that is
only Apex spawners, and ideally, a portfolio which is only Apex Spawners, 

where every company in the portfolio is a hundred billion market cap. That,
to me, would be the holy grail. We have to look at, does it have strong
spawning DNA, does it have a great capital allocator running it. What I found
about spawning is that you don’t need to make heroic assumptions. Even a
500 million or 300 million dollar business will have enough tread marks in
the past from the time they were private and when they were public, which
will make it obvious to you that, this company has spawning DNA or doesn't
have spawning DNA and the nature of that DNA. Three businesses in the
portfolio were great spawners, and they are all below a billion market cap.
Recently I found a fourth one, which is below 400 million and had a strong
spawning DNA and a very long history. You could easily tell what has been
going on in that business. Of course, the hunt is on to find more of these.
One of the reasons I am speaking to Peking U is, my email address is on this
presentation, the last slide. Please send me spawners. I am desperate for
Spawners. Okay, so set it and forget it. That is really what we want to do.
We want to get to a portfolio of maybe five to 10 spawners. I love this quote
by Thomas Phelps, and I am probably guilty of making a lot of errors. He
says, “for an individual institution really out to make a fortune in the stock
market, it can be argued, every sale is a confession of error”. Actually, if we
are doing our jobs right, what we really want to do is, we want to become
silent minority partners with Jack Ma or with Sam Walton, all with Jeff
Bezos. We want to find these people, we want to find them early, and then
we want to ride with them as long as they are riding. That is the holy grail.
Then my friend, Nick Sleep, I love this quote, this is a quote Nick put in his
last email to me, which is a few weeks ago. He said that “truly, brilliant
investors weren't investors, they were entrepreneurs that didn't sell”. He
brought up Sam Walton in this quote. In fact, one of the things I would
encourage a professor to do is to see if you can get Nick Sleep to speak to
you guys. Nick Sleep ran the Nomad Investment Partnership, I think in 2013.
They were managing about 3 billion dollars. The entire portfolio, probably
90 plus percent of it was in three stocks. It was in Amazon, Costco, and
Berkshire Hathaway. Maybe 60 or 70% of the portfolio was Amazon. If you
look at 2013, I think at that time, Amazon was around $300 a share. Nick
wrote to his investors in early 2014 that he was shutting his partnership and
he said, “look, we own three stocks, 10 years from now, we will own these
exact same three stocks”. My partner, Zach and I are not going to make any
decisions or sell anything or buy anything by selling any of these three
positions. We quite frankly, don't want to sit here and write letters to you
for the next 10 years. What we are doing is, we are shutting the partnership,
we are returning all your money, and we recommend to you that you just
put the money in the three stocks and don't pay any fees to anyone. My
guess is, both of them, Nick and Zach, probably had, let us say a couple of
hundred million each that they had made as with the carry and all that.
When they shut down Nomad, I think that's how that couple of hundred
million was invested. It was in these three stocks. It is mostly still sitting in
these three stocks. You can just calculate how well they have done. They’ve
probably beaten every professional manager out there since then. An entire
portfolio composed of 5 to 10 great spawners, at reasonable prices are likely
to do very well. You can’t easily screen for Spawners quantitatively. But
then, like Buffett says, “Why should it be easy to get rich? It's worth the
effort, and not all will get to Nirvana, but this approach can handle several
duds”. If we look at Nick Sleeps three positions, Berkshire Hathaway, Costco,
and Amazon. Berkshire actually has underperformed the S&P 500 for quite 

a while. Costco has probably done maybe a little bit better, but nothing to
get overly excited about. But Amazon was the one that really blew the doors
off. When you have a portfolio of spawners, maybe five to tens, you could
do really well with just a couple of them hitting home runs. This is an
approach that can tolerate more than a few dads. Actually, it is relatively
easy to avoid the duds because you can look at the track record. Then the
question comes up, when to get off the bus? I love this quote by Charlie.
“The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt”. Don't exit until it is
absolutely clear that a secular decline has started. Business does not go up
in a straight line. There are going to be ups and downs, ignore these
temporary headwinds. But when you have absolute clarity that the business
is in a secular decline, you can exit. Even if you give up 50%, you sell at 50%
from the peak because it would take a while for the market and you to figure
out that there is a problem here. Because you have had such a long run for
such a long time, it doesn't matter. The return is still going to be good. If you
find a long runway and you are a little late at getting off the bus, it is not
going to be a problem. The important thing is not getting off the bus for a
temporary hiccup. Quick word on conglomerates. In Korea and Japan, we
had the Chaebol’s and Keiretsu’s and these actually were incredible
spawners, but they are a little bit different in the sense that, they were given
a lot of government help and they were almost assured of success because
imports were restricted, licenses to competitors were restricted. They are a
different kind of spawner, but they have done really well. If you invested in
these businesses early in their life, like if you bought the Chaebols in the
1980s, or you bought in the Keiretsu in the 1970s, you would have done
extremely well. Mature conglomerate is very different because it has
already scaled, and it is unlikely to be a 100x from where they are at. We also
have a lot of fake spawners or spawners who lose their way, GE and IBM are
two examples of companies that actually survived for more than a hundred
years, but then lost their way. I had 200 bagger in the 1990s. CMGI was one,
which is in the US and Satyam was in India. They are both what I would call
fake spawners. I was lucky that I was able to get off the bottom, close to the
peak in both of them. But CMGI, for example, was more than a 100x. But
then they were spawning dotcoms and eventually, almost nothing worked
and the company disappeared. Satyam actually had a real business, and
then they built a dotcom on top of it. It would have been about a 25x for me
if I had collected what was truly owed to me. But I got more than 140x
because there was euphoria. Then we had a bunch of fake spawners in the
99, 2000 timeframe, like internet capital group, idea lab, safeguard
scientific. You have to make sure that the spawners you are going into are
not fake. They are real, and that they have some staying power. Pretty much
every public company was or will be a hundred bagger. I already told you
this, Walmart had already given the Walton family more than a 100x before
the 1970 IPO, it gave them another 20,000x after the IPO. There was a long
runway there. You could have gotten on the bus for a long time. That is an
unusual spawner. Companies like Uber, etc., are unlikely to deliver a 100x
post IPO because it became public at 50 billion. You would need to get to 5
trillion which I would be sceptical about. That is the song and dance, and
you see my email address there to send me the spawners. I think we can
open up to questions. Thank you.
Jiang: Great. Thank you. 

Student: Yeah, thank you. You have a very great insights about the spawners Mr.
Pabrai. You mentioned that by looking at the histories, one can find clues
about whether a company has the DNA of Spawning. My question here is,
according to your experiences, how long on average does it takes to
discover that a company at its early stage has this kind of DNA?
Mohnish: That is a good question. It will vary by company. But what I have found is
that, some of these companies that I have invested in were founded maybe
more than 20 years ago. I won't name these because I am still buying them,
but I think the one in Japan was founded in 1985, and I think they went public
around 2003. The founder was 25 years old when he started the company,
and now he is 55. He is a young 55, and the business is very non-Japanese
in the way it runs and the kind of things he has done. He is an innovative
guy. There is a very long history there. I mean, there is a 30 year history that
I could look at in that business. It is very obvious that spawning is very core
to the DNA. I think what you can do is, if you do not obviously see spawning
in the DNA of the business, and it doesn't need to be a 30-year-old business,
it can be obvious in 10 years. It can even be obvious in five years. It is just
that, you can see that relatively quickly in some businesses. But I would just
say that, if you said that I am going to have a portfolio which is only a
spawner portfolio, and I am only going to invest when it is very obvious to
me that they have great spawning DNA, and I also put upper limit on the
market cap. There is a quote from the Upanishads. The Upanishads are these
holy scripture books in India, which are probably written about 3000 years
ago. The full quote is “as is your wish, so is your will and as is your will, so is
your desire and as is your desire, so is your deed”. Then the punchline, your
deepest desire is your destiny. If you truly want something, like you are in
love with some girl and she doesn't care about you, but if you truly want
that person and you purely and totally focus on that, it will happen. The
same thing with the hunt for spawners, if you say that, it has to fit the
following criteria, there are 50,000 stocks globally, thousands in China. If
you just systematically go through that, you only need, if you can only find
one in a year, that is enough. One a year is good; you don't need too many.
You have so much time to find one, and then that is okay.
Student: Okay. Thank you.
Mohnish: All right.
Student: Thanks for the great presentation. That was a really interesting perspective.
What helps you identify spawn is, apart from their say, MNA, their spawning
history, is management an important factor that you look at and how do you
identify a good management that might turn the company into Spawner,
for example, for Amazon, probably having Jeff Bezos as a CEO was pretty
important for the company to turn into Spawner?
Mohnish: Yeah. For me, it is a very new framework. It is just a few weeks old, probably
the framework is still evolving, and in fact, you are the Guinea pigs I want to
test the framework with. That is good. What I have found so far is,
historically when I looked at businesses, let us take a business like Alphabet.
Alphabet, when they release their financial, the quarterly results of their
annual report, they talk about other bets. They have a section called other
bets, and they make all these investments in these other bets. Historically,
when I looked at a business like Alphabet, I would just take the other bets
and ascribe a zero value to them. Because I would say, who knows what is 

going to happen over here? I would say that, let us put it this way, it was
maybe not an explicit value assigned to it, but I said, Okay, this is upside
without the downside. I just say, Okay, it is good to have that, but I really
can't, right? Because these are too much embryonic, and who knows what
is going to happen with these things? Now, when I look at Alphabet, I don't
look at it that way. It becomes very clear. When I look at a company like
Alphabet, it is a spawner, very clear. There is no ambiguity about it. Not only
do I know it is a spawner, but I can also tell which categories of spawner
they are, right? I can see if have they bought embryos and grown them, or
have created businesses of their own, which are very different. Google
started with only search, right and then they bought Android, Android was
not created by Google. Android was bought, and then they scaled Android,
YouTube was bought, and they scaled YouTube. Some things they have
grown in house and some things they have bought and scaled. You can
clearly look at the categories of what they have done, and now you can say,
okay, it is very obvious Alphabet is an Apex spawner, it is very obvious. You
can say that about Alibaba, very obvious Tencent, and Baidu you can say it
about all of them. These are very obvious because once you have the
framework, you can put the categories and you are done, right? But what is
also useful is that you look at smaller businesses. Some of you may have
heard of Chamath, with his million followers, whatever he has on Twitter.
Chamath is spawning SPACs, right? The special purpose acquisition
companies and what he is saying is that he has one for every letter of the
Alphabet. I was looking yesterday at a company with the ticker symbol is
IPOB, okay? He has IPOA, IPOB, IPOC. These are all public companies. He
said they will go all the way to IPOZ. It is very obvious that Chamath is a
spawner. Now, the problem is, there is no mothership. I mean, I want to
invest in the mothership, right? Chamath, I want to invest directly with him,
not the IPOB, because I don't know if IPOB will make it or not. Chamath is
going to do really well because he is getting these facts going. Probably
more than half or two thirds of them may not work, but we don't need a
large number of them to work because they are going into such high
potential areas. For example, IPOB is a company, the name is Open Door,
and they are doing something, which I am not sure whether it will work or
not. They are basically trying to disrupt the way homes are bought and sold
in the US. Instead of me listing a home for sale, they will just come and say,
I will give you the cash today, and you are done. You don't have buyers come
and look at your home and disrupt your life and all of that. We will give you
5% less than the market price, but you don't deal with anything, and you are
done in three days. They are able to do billions of dollars’ worth of home
purchases doing this. Now, I don't know whether this business eventually
works or doesn't work, but it is one of his bets, right? I think it becomes
relatively easy once you have. In the past, I did not have the Spawner
framework. When I didn't have the Spawner framework, I would just look at
Google’s other bets and just say, “Oh, we don't know”. Now I know that if
the company has spawned DNA like Google, if Google was less than a 500
billion market cap or even a 5 billion market cap, I would want to invest in
that because I can say that it is in their DNA. I mean, they are giving one day
in a year to employees to do whatever they want. It is in their DNA to create
new businesses, right? I think it becomes very obvious when you look at a
lot of companies with that framework in mind. You can tell it is obvious that
they are a spawn or they are not a spawner. 

Student: Okay, thanks a lot. Perhaps a quick follow on question if that is fine. How do
you then evaluate that spawning part of the business? How would you
evaluate Google's extra bets, because I guess doing a discounted cash flow
is pretty difficult on that.
Mohnish: I would say you still can't value it, but what you would be willing to do is,
pay more for the rest of the business.
Student: Okay
Mohnish: Previously, I would have taken an approach saying other bets at zero, I want
for free. I am not paying for it. Now that I understand that DNA is like that, I
am willing to pay something for the DNA.
Student: Okay, that makes sense. So you make a normal,
Mohnish: So you can say that, okay, let us say the business has the value of, for
example, pieces that you can value. These other bets would be zero. You
might say, I will give them 5, 10 billion for that other piece.
Student: Thank you
Mohnish: Because zero might be too extreme.
Student: Okay, That makes sense. Thanks a lot.
Student: Hi Mr. Pabrai, thank you for sharing. I think the key is really knowing who is
a spawner and who is a fake one. Early on in your research, what is the
common like culture or management style that you found among the
successful spawners? You listed a few companies, but can you give us a
company that you thought was a spawner at the beginning, but over time
you found that it was actually not?
Mohnish: Well, I actually invested in a fake spawner in 1995 and the end result was, I
made 140 times my money and now it was a hundred times my money. I put
a hundred thousand, I got 10 million out. God loves me because after I sold
the stock, it crashed and burned, not before I sold it, which was great. But
CMGI was a business that was an internet incubator. In 1999, in that
timeframe, there were a number of businesses created, which were all
internet incubators. Ideal Lab was one, Safeguard Scientific was another
one, CMGI was another one, internet capital group with another one. There
were a bunch of these, and a number of these were public companies.
Because I was in the IT business, you can say I was like two steps ahead of
the rest of the market, not very far ahead, just a little bit ahead. I could see
that on the internet, I think it was in 93 or 94 that I saw whitehouse.gov. The
first website I ever saw was in 93 whitehouse.gov. I was just looking at the
world wide web and all that at that time, and I could see that this thing could
be transformational. At that time, I was saying, “I know the internet will be
big. I have no idea who the winners are going to be. What have I invested in
a company that just keeps spawning these companies, and we don't need a
high hit rate”. If you are paying very little for the mothership, at the time I
invested in CMGI, I was not paying much more than cash for the business. It
was not really understood by the market. As they started creating these
dotcom, which eventually didn't go anywhere, the market got very excited
about these businesses. Just like they are excited now about these SPACs.
Those SPACs may have legs, we don't know, we will see how it goes. Then,
the valuations became so extreme that I just felt that this is in bubble 

territory. Now, I couldn't still tell in 2000 whether their businesses were
making it or not. I just felt that the valuation was ridiculous. I got off the bus.
I think if you are riding curves, and especially if you are riding flavor of the
day curves, it may be hard to be able to tell which one is a fake and which
one is not a fake. For example, the year 2020 is the year of the SPACs.
Everyone has a SPAC, clearly, there is when you have that type of stuff
happening, it is likely that there is a bubble there. It is likely that a lot of
those will not go anywhere. But it also could be possible that, if you could
find a way to invest in mothership, like I would like to invest in Chamath if I
can find a way to do it cheaply, not the SPACs he is creating, but directly
him without paying high premium, that would be interesting. I think what
you can do if you want to make sure that you avoid the fake ones is, don't
take flyers on these things where you can't tell. Set a high bar saying it has
to be obvious it is not fake. For example, I have these four investments in
these four spawners. I don't think any of them are fake because they have
such a long history. We will see, but I don't know how many of them will
actually go to 10x or 100x. We will have to see what happens there. I am
pretty sure at least, one or two of them will get there.
Student: Sorry. For these four companies that you own the spawners, what would
you say is the common factor, a commonality among the management
style, like philosophy or their management style that makes you believe
that?
Mohnish: Yeah, the common element across all of them is that there is a long history
that I could study about management. I could look at their behaviour and
what they have actually executed over a very long period of time. I think in
the case of the Japanese company, I could see 30 years. Some of the other
companies I am able to see, at least 10, 15 years of history, which is a lot to
gives you a lot of data on that. It becomes obvious if the business doesn't
have more than five or 10 years of history, then you have to be able to get
that level of history on the CEO or leader, what they have done in the past.
You have to have at least 10, 15 years of history on the leader.
Student: I see. On just on a practical side, If we look at let’s say Facebook, Google,
Tencent or Alibaba, and if we want to pick them up before there were 5
billion US dollar in market cap or even 10 billion US dollar in market cap, I
think at the time they were not spawners. They were very small, single
business with very highly uncertain future. I am curious, the holdings that
you hold, these are long history, but still with long history of spawning, but
still like under 10 billion is that the case?
Mohnish: Yeah. The thing is that, if I were to give you their names, it would be
underwhelmed because they are not in the sexy businesses that Google and
Tencent are in. Okay. I think Google, Tencent, Alibaba is flavor of the day.
Everyone loves them. I would say that yes, I agree with you completely, well,
I won't say agree completely. I would say a business like Google was not a
spawner, but it was not a fly by night company when it came public. When
it came public, they dominated search and they had disrupted the previous
players completely on search. They were sitting at 90% market share. You
could easily tell with AdWords that their revenue potential just on search
was huge. Google would have been a bet that would have been based on
search, right? It would not have been a bet based on spawning. But then,
what you could have done if you had this presentation at the time is that, as 

they started to spawn, then you would know that this is a keeper, don't ever
sell this. Another way to use a framework is that, you may invest in a
business that does not have any trade marks that it is a spawner and it turns
into one. I mean, I would say that probably, when Li Lu made first
investment in BYD very early, it was not a spawner, but then he suddenly
enters the car business which is completely different than the business they
were in, in the past and probably a lot of people are deeply sceptical of that
move and he made that work, and then you can now see that he can do all
of that. I think sometimes you may stumble into a spawner in the
sense that you invest in a company which is a one trick pony, but it turns
into a multi, and when that happens, you have a way to kind of put a
framework around that and say, Okay, I can keep this business because now
it has spawning DNA.
Student: Got it. Thank you very much.
Mohnish: Sure.
Student: Thank you Mr. Pabrai for such great inspirations. I am just wondering, when
you try to identify new spawner, are you concerned if companies may get a
little bit too excited in burning cash or get distracted along the way instead
of really other things they are truly good at? For example, if McDonald's tried
to be a spawner in the early days, is it possible that it may just not get to
where this at today?
Mohnish: Yeah, one of the core DNA traits of a great spawner is, they are not going to
make large early bets. They will be unwilling to bet the farm. I mean, this is
classically what entrepreneurs do. What they want is a free lunch. If we
study BYD's entry into N95 masks, for example, it is a completely different
business than where they were in the future or in the past, but I am almost
certain if I study the numbers, I would find that if that completely failed, it
would be around error for them. It would not affect maybe 90% of
everything else that they have. The key trait a great spawner has to have is
that, when they make a bet, (and Amazon has this in the DNA), the bets are
not very large bets. They do know a lot of capital until they see traction. They
will put some money at it, then if they see there is something happening,
they will put some more money. If they see something's happening, they
will put some more money and they will keep going from there. The
moment they start seeing that this is not working, they will pull back. If I
look at Amazon with their fire phone, for example, they were very excited
about it, but when they saw there is no traction, they buried it and they
moved on. The bet size relative to the mothership for a good spawner is, the
bet is always going to be small. No good spawner is going to bet the
mothership on an unproven flyer. That is one of the DNA things you can look
for. When they start doing these things, are they doing them on a small scale
or are they doing them on a large scale? I think that there is a lot to be said
for companies that don't do spawning. Spawning is hard. Spawning requires
you to have an approach where you can watch five or 10 things and be good
at watching five or 10 things. Most humans are not good at that. They need
to be focused on one thing. Very few companies can actually be good
spawner companies. If I look at a company like Costco, Costco is the classic
unspawner, one format and they have just stuck to that format forever, and
they will not change that format, and that works well. It is a great
investment, it has worked out great for a long time. I think you have to make 

sure that the spawner that you are looking at is not one that is making erratic
huge bets. I would say that I don't know whether Tesla is a good example,
but if we look at Tesla, one of the things that are bothersome to me about
Tesla is, Elon doesn't care about money. He cares about a lot of other things.
He cares about dying on Mars, just not on impact. But he does not care
about money. He just sold all his homes. He doesn't even care about home.
The thing is that capital allocation by someone like that is kind of
bothersome to me, right? Because he could make a really large bet on
something unproven, that would be entirely within what Elon would do. It
is not the way Jeff Bezos would operate. I think you have to understand that.
Student: Mr. Pabrai thanks for sharing and its a quite unique hammer and
perspective. I have two questions. First one is, I am very curious about the
persistence of spawning because most of these founders of authentic
spawners like Facebook or Alibaba are still starting but how about the
company's controlled by professional executives? The second question is
how to balance the whole investment structure and match to avoid the risk
of with Hammer and the word looks like a nail proposed by Charlie Munger.
Thank you.
Mohnish: Yeah, I think that you are absolutely right that the spawning DNA is very
critical. When I look at the Munger I have invested in or accidentally invested
in, they are founder led. The founder has the DNA and the founder still is
young or relatively young and still running with the same DNA and yes, you
have to study that. You have to make sure that you have enough data that
the next generation can run things. In some cases, the next generation can
be better than the previous generation. For example, in India, one of the
largest companies is Reliance Industries. The second generation is running
it, and the second generation is better than the founder. The son is better
than the father. It would have taken some time to understand that is the
case and I did not. I think, if there is a transition that has taken place to
professional management and the spawning took place while there was a
founder, it is a red flag. You have to have enough data on the professional
manager, whether they understand that. One of the things we don't know,
we would have to see that when a business like Amazon transitions to the
next leader, the next leader has the spawning DNA deeply entrenched into
the business so much that the next leader has that hardwired and ready to
go. We will have to see if that is actually the case. I did not get your second
question. Can you repeat the second question?
Student: Okay. The second question is how to balance the whole investment
structure and to avoid the risk of Hammer, the world looks like a nail. It is
proposed by Charlie Munger.
Mohnish: Yeah, I think the thing is that you have to make sure you are not fooling
yourself because you are the easiest person to fool. take a step
back. One of the things Charlie Munger had told me, he said, “it is always
good to have somebody to bounce your investment ideas with, someone
you can talk to about your investment ideas”. I said, “you mean like you had
Warren? He said, I did not always have Warren. He said, sometimes I would
discuss my ideas with somebody else, not always Warren Buffett, but he
said that it was in investing, it is very important and the person you should
discuss your ideas with needs to be a peer. It cannot be like an employeeemployer relationship because there, the hierarchy may make the candid 

sharing of perspectives harder, but if you can share your ideas with a peer
who can be honest and candid with you, that is one way to avoid thinking
everything looks like a nail. You have to avoid making sure you don't think
everything looks like a nail.
Student: I am really wondering if this whole spawning picture is like the hammer for
right now because maybe not every company can be classified as spawners
or non-spawner.
Mohnish: I think that if you look at every business, let us say we look at hundred
random businesses and we decide that we want to start separating them
into spawner and non-spawner. I think what you are going to find is, it is not
a binary 01, okay? You are going to find that, there are companies that are
complete non-spawners, extreme non-spawner, and there are companies
that are extreme spawner. Throughout the continuum, you will find
companies across that continuum. There would be companies that would
have what I would call strong spawning DNA and then with the others that
would have weak spawning DNA. It would be a continuum. It wouldn't be a
binary switch if you looked at different businesses. As long as you can
identify where you want to be, you say that spawning has to be a strong
part of the business, then of course, I think you will be able to separate
them. The other thing is that, just like in baseball, there is no call like, it is
okay to let a spawner go, which is, it is okay to miss a spawner. It is
problematic to think something is a spawner, but it is not. If you miss an
Alibaba, you miss a Google, that is okay, but don't bring in McDonald's
thinking it is a spawner when it's not. That is more problematic. I think what
I am saying is that it should be obvious that a company has strong spawning
DNA. I think it is pretty obvious to tell that, in my opinion. The other thing
about this is that I have a hypothesis, which is a hypothesis today because I
don't have the data, but I would hypothesize that, if I had a portfolio of 10
spawners carefully selected, 10% bet in each spawner and I didn't touch it
for a long time, I think the odds are good. If you have done your selections
properly, three or four may not be really good and that is all you need. If you
get two or three that are really good, it will make up for all the mistakes that
you can come up with in all the other ones. If you just identify a few, that
gives you very strong returns, as long as you don't lose much money on the
others, you will be okay. I think it is an approach that can tolerate you being
wrong. Business is difficult. Trying to forecast the future of a business is
difficult no matter what. We may be wrong on some of these spawners and
that is perfectly okay, we don't need to be right on all of them. He really was
absolutely right on one business and that is all. The first Amazon shares he
bought were at $30 a share in 2002, right? He never sold, and he bought at
$30, he bought a hundred dollars, he bought a $200, he even bought a $300,
right? It didn't matter, there were about a dozen companies in his portfolio.
This was the only consequence that mattered. It didn't matter what else was
happening.
Student: Thank you for sharing everything so generously. I have two questions. My
first question is, because the past 10 years were a bull market. Does same
make you change into the framework of spawner? What if the past 10 year
have been the bear market, would you have a different thinking or change
your philosophy and a quick follow up on CMGI, because you somehow
capture a whole hundred percent x. If the position was not 10% bet, if they
were a hundred percent bet, would you be too worried about the position 

or you somehow not be able to capture the whole process? I know there
was a mistake because you mentioned that you said you should have sold
at 5x. My question is, does that position sizing make you become less
worried about the position so you could catch the whole process?
Mohnish: Those are good questions. With CMGI, actually, what happened at that time
was, in 1994, my net worth was $1 million. It was a 10% bet. A hundred
thousand dollars. I let that bet run for five years and it just kept going up. I
saw they were spawning all these companies and I said, maybe some of
these will hit, we will see. Eventually, what happened is, the entire portfolio
was worth about 14 or 15 million. Close to about 15 million. CMGI was sitting
at about two-thirds of the entire portfolio. But I was not a professional
money manager then. It was my own money and I really didn't feel or care
that there was this degree of concentration. I was paying more attention to
it as it became a larger and larger portion of my net worth and that is why I
eventually, when it got to about 10 million, I looked at the numbers, I said,
this thing this thing could blow up with the... I am not sure. At that point, I
felt like 10 million will change my life. Okay. Guaranteed to change my life,
right? I said, let us ring the register and put the money in the drawer and we
are set with that. That was part of the thinking, but I didn't really want to do
anything with it earlier. I think your second point about the last 10 years and
so on, in my opinion, I think spawning transcends markets just like great
businesses transcend markets. I think that if we find a great entrepreneur
who is executing well, those businesses can do well regardless of the
markets we are in. As long as we are able to invest them at a reasonable
valuation, the bear market might make it easier to find those kinds of
businesses because no one is interested.
Student: One more question.
Mohnish: Go ahead.
Student: My question is about short-term suffering. Because in 1970, Charlie Munger
has suffered, his investment portfolio was suffering a lot. Mohnish you also
said before that every time you buy something, things go down by like 20%.
My question is how do you feel about lost short-term suffering?
Mohnish: There is a saying, if wealth is lost, nothing is lost. If health is lost, something
is lost. If character is lost, everything is lost. We are just talking about wealth.
If you buy a stock and it goes down 20%, which happens to every stock I
buy, by the way, you are not buying a stock, you are buying a business, right?
Before you buy the business, you have to understand what that business
does and what that business is worth. Then you are not going to get
distressed. In fact, you should get happy if it has gone down, you can maybe
get some more than what you had before. It has never bothered me, stock
prices move around and all that. I think it is in the nature of auction-driven
markets, that is, we are going to see these swings. If you just look at the
Shanghai stock market and you throw a Dart, if you have a page with all the
stock names and just throw a dart at any name, just look at the 52-week
range of prices on that stock. It will be 70 to150. Or 30 to 70, right? I mean,
every stock in one year has a range, which is so wide. If we look at home
prices over one year, the change is 5% or 10% or 15%. It is not 50%. Auction
driven markets are going to give you very wide swings both ways. We can
take advantage of those swings. It is just in the nature of auction driven 

markets that you are going to have movement and volatility. There is just
part of the game.
Student: Hi Mohnish, how are you? Thank you very much again for sharing your very
candid thoughts with us. My question is a little bit different from the
previous ones. The first question is related to Berkshire Hathaway, you are
quite close with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Any thoughts about
Berkshire's latest trade? For example, dumping Costco and selling many
banks stock, etc., and the second question, I am not sure is proper not so
feel free to share whatever you can. Your portfolio seems quite
concentrated, IEMU and SRG from some public materials. You had SRG in
2017, and now you loaded quite heavily from the second quarter this year.
Any reason inside that you could share with us? Thank you very much.
Mohnish: All right. Any data I have about Costco or the banks is not coming from
Warren or Charlie, it is just what I think, the Costco sale is a complete
surprise to me. There is very few companies that Charlie loves more than
Costco. Every time I meet him, in fact, the last time I had dinner with him,
we spend so much time talking about Costco. Every time I meet him, we
talk about Costco, like he was asking me if I visit Costco and I told him, now
Costco delivers to my home. I don't have to go to Costco, they deliver to my
home. He said, “Oh, then you have to pay too many fees. Please go to Costco
to get cheaper price”. Anyway, I have no idea why they sold Costco. The only
thing I would say is, investors buy stocks for only one reason. They sell
stocks for 100 reasons. Okay? We cannot tell anything about what someone
is thinking when they sell a stock. We can tell something about what
someone is thinking when they buy a stock. All right? Just keep that in mind
because there are many different reasons people could be selling. The bank
stocks well, they are really good at banks, so they would know better what
is going on there. But I know that Warren, from the actions I have seen,
deeply loves Bank of America and maybe not so much Wells Fargo anymore,
just from the actions I am seeing regarding my own portfolio what gets
reported is the US positions. We have two holdings in the US, Micron and
Seritage. Those show up in the quarterly filings. I don't really have a whole
lot to say about either one. I mean, I would say that Seritage, Micron we
have held for, I think about maybe more than a couple of years now, but,
Seritage we bought a stake in the second quarter of this year. The stock
price was down 70, 80% from where it was a few weeks before that. Maybe
that would give you some clue as to why I might be interested, but I do want
to clarify that Seritage is not a spawner. In fact, Seritage is what I would call
as unspawned because they keep selling some assets to keep the ship
going. It is the opposite of a spawner because it was bought in an era when
I did not have the Spawner framework. But I am still very happy with that
investment.
Terence: Thank you Mohnish, I really appreciate your time. I have really two quick
questions. The first one is, you mentioned you were starting your own
business while working full time, after work, and then spending on
weekends. Do you think you would become the investor you are today
without that entrepreneurial and operating experience? My second quick
question is that you emphasize on the circle of competence, right? Do you
think physical location is a big part of that? Because for example, even
though I am Chinese, but I live in the US, I feel like I understand the business
dynamics much more about US than China. Do you think the physical 

location matter, obviously you and Warren and Charlie invested in
companies without probably visiting those countries. What’s your thoughts
on that as well? Thank you.
Mohnish: Yeah, those are good questions, Terence. Yes, I think it is a very big
advantage if you do business before, in fact, specifically the spawner
framework. I am not sure I could have come up with the framework if I had
not run businesses before. Because when I was running my IT company, and
I thought about it when I was doing the Spawner framework, I was doing
spawning in that business and it was adjacent spawning, right and I saw how
little capital, it took some brain power, but it took very little capital and
some of these bets that I made where the amount invested was so small,
but they grew quite significantly. I saw the power of spawning directly, and
that is when I realized that I have to pay attention. When I transported my
own personal experience into some of these public companies and started
looking at them, I could look at them from the same lens as I had looked at.
Definitely, I think it is a huge advantage if you have run businesses before
and such. I think there is no substitute for that. The second is that I think in
terms of the circle of competence and where to invest and so on, I think you
have to have a very high conviction. Anytime you are making investments,
you have to have a very high conviction. You cannot be concerned that you
don't understand something or whatever. The thing about investing is that
the size of the circle of competence that we have is irrelevant. What is more
relevant is that we stay within the circle. I think I have talked even in this
class about Charlie's friend John Arriaga, who only invests in real estate
within two miles of the Stanford campus. He is a billionaire, he only
understands not only real estate, but within real estate, he only understands
real estate in a very small area. If someone told him to invest in real estate
in Los Angeles or another state or anywhere, he would just not be
interested. It did not stop him from becoming very wealthy. If you look at
all these entrepreneurs like Sam Walton or Ray Kroc or any of these
companies, Jim Sinegal with Costco, their expertise is very narrow
expertise, but they became very wealthy. It is the same in investing. The
important thing in investing is to stick to things that you are really good at
and things that you really understand well. That is where you will get the
biggest edge, and that is how you should approach it.
Yi Lu: Mr. Pabrai, in your last experience, what is your biggest mistake in investing
and what influences did it have on you?
Mohnish: Well, I think the area of investing that gave me the most trouble was
companies with leverage. I had many investments over the last 26 years that
did not work well, and a good number of them are concentrated on
companies that either had too much debt or they were financial services
companies where leverage was inherent in their model. I have been trying
to make sure that the companies and businesses I’m investing in, do not
have a big dependency on debt and leverage. I still have businesses in the
portfolio even today that have leverage. I think they are okay, but we will
find out. Maybe I am like an alcoholic who has not given up alcohol yet, but
I definitely want to minimize, a good business should not need debt to do
well. Good businesses can do well without debt.
Jiang: All right. Already two hours, it’s about midnight in California. I think we have
a very wonderful two hours listening to your talk and your question and 

answer, actually, your first talk to us is through online like in 2016. The
second one is on site here at the campus in 2017. Now we are in 2020, the
third time online. I hope next year you will come back to Peking University
campus to speak to this class again.
Mohnish: Yeah, well, that would be a pleasure and an honor, I haven't gotten on an
airplane for about 10 months now, and it will be very good to be able to
travel maybe, I think May or June of next year onwards. In fact, one of the
first trips I will be making to China, so looking forward to that. Thank you.
Jiang: Okay. I think when you visit China, someone from this class will accompany
you like last time.
Mohnish: Yeah that will be wonderful
Jiang: This class took you to Moutai
Mohnish: I am hoping some of your students will give me a Chinese spawner tour of
everything below 500 million.
Jiang: All right. Okay.
Mohnish: That is the goal.
Jiang: Okay. It also amazed me that value investors as successful as you still like
developing new ideas. Although the title of your talks this time is the same
as last one, but the content is brand new. Is spawners, as this is a new source
and new ideas, new framework. I think this can also tell our students that,
as a value investor, never stop learning.
Mohnish: Yeah. I was not sure whether I should give this talk because it will mean I
will have more competition, but it is okay. No problem. The plus side is, I will
get feedback, which will be helpful, so that is great.
Jiang: Yeah. Okay.
Mohnish: Thank you very much. Thank you, Professor. Wonderful.
Jiang: Let us see, Chang would you say something?
Chang: Yeah, it is very inspiring to listen to this. As value investors, we always have
to think about, what kind of companies we are investing in and how they
can generate terms for us. Right. When you mention about BYD, to us, it is
more like a public venture company. They do have some very interesting
managerial and company type of competitive advantages that they
leverage on, their manufacturing power and research capability that they
leverage on. They also made many bad investment decisions. Like Yeah.
Mohnish: But I think one thing you probably have seen with BYD is, the individual bets
cannot sync the company.
Chang: Yeah, that is right
Mohnish: The bets are sized so that you can have a high failure rate and it is okay, you
don't need very many of them to work. If they work, then they can scale
quite a bit. 

Chang: Yeah. That is very important. The insight I learned, the entrepreneurs, how
they make investments, you are totally right. They may bet that they did not
kill themselves, that is very important. Yeah.
Mohnish: Because I think that they are making such early-stage bets that, by
definition, there is going to be a high failure rate. There is no way to avoid
the failure rate. It is going to be high. Yeah, but it also means that the ones
that work have huge runways.
Chang: That is right. But the problem is, a lot of time when we look at these types
of companies, they are too expensive for us.
Mohnish: You have to find the ones that the public doesn't understand
