i heard about warren buffett and charlie munger and ben graham around 1994 and i was really quite taken with their approach to investing and i have been applying their methods for about five years with some good success and i had a few friends i used to give them stock tips here and there they approached me in early 99 and they said that this stock tip business is very random you know sometimes you tell us to buy something then we don't see you for a while and then we don't know whether we should hold or sell or what we should do and so we'd like to systematize that so they proposed that they would collectively give me about a million dollars about a hundred thousand dollars each and they wanted me to manage that and i thought of that really as a hobby because on one million dollars you're not going to make the rent payment and but i also wanted to make sure that my friends did not have any kind of a negative experience with this so i set up a partnership and i cloned the the rules of the buffett partnerships in the 1950s like no management fees a six percent hurdle and so on and you know redemptions once a year and so on so for iphone started in july 99 with one million dollars from eight of my friends and i put in a hundred thousand as well and i would say about 15 months after that in late 2000 i thought that i was really enjoying this running the fund etc by then the assets were about two and a half million we had had a big run-up i think we were up 70 in the first year and so at that point i decided i should really treat it like a real business and bring in more investors and assets and so on and so then after that the funds gradually scaled and then they got up to several hundred million so that's how it got going okay and has the what's your fund objective the way that you're looking at stocks changed over the last five ten years compared to those first 10 years  i mean i think that in this business you need to be a continuous learning build machine and i think the one thing with investing is that all knowledge is cumulative so unlike you know being a you know basketball player or a football player as you pile on the years you should be getting better and such that's wonderful and you can keep getting better into your 70s or 80s and such which is also great so  i mean the you know as i get to more experience and i'm able to learn from especially the mistakes and also from other investors the model changes periodically i made a significant change last year in the way i run the funds and the big driver of that was that when i read the full set of letters by nick sleep he's the guy who used to run the nomad investment partnership in london and those letters i think are floating around on the internet now so if you just you know google next sleep nomad letters i think you can get the full set and i highly recommend them nick had done really well and i think him and his partner zach over the years got some very good insights and when i looked at their model and what they were doing i felt that it was vastly better than the approach i was taking and their model is really looking at these ownership stakes in businesses really as if you were the founder or the manager of the business and to think about it in the way the founding family would think about it and so that basically stretches out time horizons it's also changes the type of businesses you invest in and it's very tax efficient and actually i think more satisfying okay no that's very interesting did that change with the way that you're valuing companies because of the pandemic i think no it doesn't so much change how you value businesses i think the difference is that instead of buying a business that is undervalued maybe you know 50 off or 60 off from what its intrinsic value is you focus more on long-term compounders and businesses that can grow and scale over time so instead of just buying what what i've done for a long time which is discounted pies the focus changes to growing buys and growing pies you may have to sometimes pay a bit more for them because usually they're recognized as better businesses but in many cases the end result is a lot better okay all right so georgetown is very international focused and we had a lot of students really wanted to hear kind of your thoughts on investing in multiple countries i know that's something that you have a lot of experience in  so i mean i think one of the issues i was facing in the last few years is i was finding it difficult to find businesses to invest in the united states thing work and we may now be entering a period of uneuphoria which is fine but things seem to be priced to perfection or even overpriced etc in the case of some good businesses and some not so good businesses and so i wanted to broaden out what i was looking at and i could tell that there were some countries where just the entire market was cheap and these are places that people are not interested in investing in equities things like places like japan korea turkey and so on and over the years you know i've had interaction with investors and fund managers all over the world and for example i have a good friend in seoul who's a very good fund manager he's very well trained in the methods of buffett monger and graham and so naturally if i were to look at the things that he's investing in many of those things would be of interest to me so i asked him if i could visit seoul and if we could just go and visit all the companies in his portfolio and he said oh that would be such a blast so i made a few trips in the last few years to korea usually their week-long trips and they we usually end up seeing about 15 or 20 businesses and there have been incredible learning opportunities and because i had a a trusted friend who knew the the landscape and in you know i think like for example in in this case i was looking at you know whether i should clone things the day of that cloning is very powerful model because it's already been through one set of filters and and such and similarly in turkey there's a there's a very good friend of mine who is a a smart investor he's more grand than munger and i'm trying to transition him from ram to manga it's the same in korea because these markets are so cheap it becomes very tempting to just look at you know things are trading at three times earnings and such and not really focus on the better businesses that may be at eight or nine times earnings so these last few years i made several trips in in these countries and i met dozens of businesses and we've we've got investments in turkey and in korea now and we like those investments and so that's that's been helpful i was going to go last year to china but then that trip got cancelled because of covid and so that's hopefully once we get past all the lockdowns and such then that'll be one of my first trips as well to china related to specifically looking at businesses okay and is there anything that changes whenever you're evaluating it from one country to the next well i think you have to  there are some cultural nuances i think you should be sensitive to i think it's helpful to understand how the managers and owners think about these businesses and it's important to understand the cultural aspects of some of these some of these countries as an overlay on top of the business analysis but for the most part it's not that that different you know a business of the business and you know we want to look at the future cash flows and then we want to discount those back so most of those things are pretty standard across the board all right and would you mind walking us through maybe some of your thoughts on some past investments either what made you decide to get in or get out of them well there's a large list of past investments would you like losers or winners i guess the one that you think is the most interesting well i think the the best lessons come from the losers we don't really learn much from the winners we do make some money and we pat ourselves on the back so i think the when we lose money that those lessons get seared in and i had created a checklist maybe around 13 years ago and it's a pre-investment checklist and it goes through evolution over time you keep adding more questions but what i found in that checklist is that the and it was created looking at all the mistakes great investors have made where there was enough data before the investment was made that should have given the investor some pause but they went ahead anyway so there was something that was visible as a in the armor if you will and so what i found is i looked at these investments that these great investors made and they didn't work out they fell into what four or five categories the largest category the one with the biggest number of mistakes was related to leverage so leverage was a big part of why investments didn't work out another big part was misunderstanding of the mode and the competitive advantage of somehow not not fully grasping the realities of the moat or the lack thereof and then the third big beat was the piece was management and ownership just kind of issues related to them i have had a lot of difficulty over the last couple of decades with companies with leverage and i've had multiple zeros which is a hundred percent loss of the invested capital because of leverage and so i'm a lot more leery about going into situations where there's a great amount of debt although we do have in businesses in our portfolio currently which have significant debt but there was a lot of work i did on making sure it was ring-fenced and it couldn't really hurt you if you will so a big one was in i think in 2008 2007 late 2000 in the financial crisis we owned a mortgage company delta financial and delta financial basically used to they were actually a sensible underwriter of mortgages but so they would they would issue a bunch of mortgages they had these various lines of credit and then they would package those securitize those and get those off their balance sheet make their money and then go buy some more so that was their business which is you know write the mortgages and put them on the warehouse lines and then bundle them and sell them to investors and then release the money and keep going and it was a very profitable business because they didn't need much equity and so on but they got caught with a significant amount of mortgages in their warehouse lines and the music stopped on the securitizations so they couldn't they couldn't get them out and then they started tripping covenants and eventually with these housing prices started declining and such it eventually took them out they went bankrupt and we had a pretty significant loss i think around 50 60 million that we lost on delta financial so that's an example of you know we're not going to be doing any mortgage companies in the near future we haven't done any since then either so that's quite understandable and you mentioned a minute ago looking for competitive advantages and looking for compounders what are your thoughts on looking for that competitive advantage in businesses well usually it will show up in the numbers so if the business has a strong moat and strong advantages then you will see over a long period of time it's showing up in the revenue and the growth and the cash flows you know like if you look at a company like mastercard you can just look at numbers and see that it's a great business and so motes generally will make themselves quite visible most of the time and so i think it's not that hard to sift through businesses and separate them into which ones are great which ones are not so great the issue that comes in is that usually the businesses that are great are usually well recognized as such and are usually trading at either full price or overpriced and so it's a combination of finding a great business and maybe either misunderstood or facing some temporary headwinds which has decimated the price and then that in that circumstance you would step in and do quite well okay well thank you for that so we're about to turn it over to let the audience ask questions but before we do that do you want to say anything about your your foundation that you've started well  so my wife and i had started the dakshina foundation in 2006. it was becoming clearer around then 2006 2007 that we would end up with significantly more assets than we could consume in our lifetime and so when you find yourself in that circumstance there are really only two things you can do you could either give it to your gene pool or you could in some way recycle it back to society and giving it to your gene pool you know i think buffett has a quote he's saying if you're jesse owens son you're not really going to become a great sprinter by starting at the 40 meter line you know when everyone's starting at the zero meter line if you start at the 40 meter line that's not going to make you into a great sprinter and so large inheritances actually are a disservice to the future members of your gene pool because you know the fun for us was making it you know figuring it out and having a productive life if you're on a iv drip throughout your life you know that's probably is just like having an iv drip in the hospital you know doesn't sound so interesting so i think basically if you eliminate the pro possibilities of just giving it to your gene pool and it's okay to give something to your gene pool like i think you could put jesse oven son at the 5 meter line not the 40 meter line that's probably okay then the only choice left is to give it back to society and what i wanted to do so i knew we were going to recycle back i wanted to do it similar to the way we do investing we just look for high social return on invested capital and so i didn't want to just have you know some building named after me or something that has no appeal to me but i wanted to see if these resources could be used in a efficient way for the benefit of society and actually it's worked out really well akshana basically helps very poor underprivileged kids who are very bright in india and we prep them and get them accepted at the top elite schools in india and these elite schools in india are pretty cheap to attend but they're very hard to get into so the prep is very expensive and so because we provide the prep for free it's a level it takes away the advantage the rich or upper middle class kids have and it's worked out really well we've had several thousand kids get into the iits and the top medical schools and so on and so it's been very satisfying and it's done far better than i would have thought so it's worked out great well good good that's great to hear and it looks like chris has his hand up here thank you very much clayton great job for organizing this and thank you all for coming when you say as a part of our graduate investment point of care we invest we're a long equity fund we invest in just different public securities essentially and we're benchmarked to the msci acqui all country world index is our as our benchmark index we want to share so and we know your specialty as you you were mentioning is value investing so our portfolio over the last several years has been actually traditionally more high growth stocks that have performed quite well in the tax space particularly our ford pe is about 23 for our entire portfolio versus the msci equity which is around 18 which has done well over the last two years but this year it's starting to hurt us as we see you know with with the the yield curve increasing and steepening and that's hurting some of the very expensive names in our portfolio and we're looking to add more value and kind of would love to get your your opinion and advice as to some things we should be looking at to to incorporate more value for the market trends this year well i mean i think that i wouldn't look at the trends and i also wouldn't be particularly concerned about forward pe of 23 versus market at 18 or whatever i think that the pe is a you know it's an inadequate metric to help us too much so i think what really matters is the businesses that you own in the portfolio what are their prospects in the next five or ten years and what what kind of revenues and cash flows to generate over that period and so if they are growing at you know if you're paying 23 times forward earnings but if these businesses are growing at 20 30 a year and that growth would continue for you know five or ten years those are not expensive businesses and i would ignore whatever noise there is with temporary you know drawdowns and so on and so i think it's it's really a matter of i never focus on what is happening in markets and you know macro events and all of that i think at the end of the day what matters is how does a particular business do over a long period of time and so i think that one of the things i learned last year from nick sleep so you know nick sleep said that you know walmart went public in 1970 and it's now 51 years and the only investors who have held the stock for 51 years is the walton family and other investors did not hold it for 50 years or 40 years or even 30 years and nick sleep makes the point that for a large portion of walmart's history like in the 70s and maybe even into the 80s you could have paid 100 times earnings for walmart and you would have still had a home run and you would have still beaten the market so walmart is a business that has shown us that the post-public runway because they were private before that which they also did very long but just as a public company that runway has lasted for over half a century and it doesn't look like it's running out of steam anytime soon they're still cranking i think the important thing in investing is can i tell what a business looks like five years or ten years from now what are their cash flows likely to be and i think the important thing that i learned from nick sleeve is if you find yourself in the position of having ownership in a great business which has great growth prospects for a long time the best thing to do is do nothing just and we might have drawdowns and different things going on because you know when the index goes down everything goes down but what we should focus on is the underlying business app thank you very much thank you and let's hear jesus want to ask your question yes thank you very much moniz i am a long time ago follower of you guys here and i was in omaha two two years ago but i didn't see you and i have a couple of questions but i just limit to one what advice would you give to us as younger investors in case we wanted to start our own investment vehicles you have been advocated a lot for the zero twenty five structure fee but i don't see that it's official at least in the at the beginning and which advice would you give to us to if we want to start with our own thing with our own vehicle so i'm sorry you you said it's not feasible at the beginning i don't know that's my question  so i think that  so i would recommend the 0625 structure and i would recommend that structure right from the beginning you know if i were to maybe tell the story of lilu who is the money manager for charlie munger munger gave him money to manage because lilu came as a penniless student from china you know studying at colombia on student loans and there was a float between the time he got the loan and the time the money was spent or the tuition was paid and in that float period he invested the money and by the time he graduated he had over a million dollars just from the float of the student loans and then he continued to invest and his net worth continued to go up so charlie munger's perspective is that if he were going to give a money manager money to manage the first basic criteria he would look for is is the guy financially independent because if you are a gifted money manager even if you start with small sums and you're beating the market by some healthy margin probably by the time you're 35 or 40 you should be independently wealthy and if that is not the case then charlie would say well you don't deserve to get money from him to be to be managing so the the first question i would ask any money manager is what has been your wealth accumulation with your own money before you're looking for other people to give you money to manage in my in my case for example i had sold a portion of my business for about a million dollars in 94 and i think by 1999 i wasn't even asking people to give me money they had come to request me to take their money by 1993 that that was north of 10 million so in about five years it had gone up more than 10x and buffett says that if you are a manager who has delivered and maybe in the future is likely to deliver significantly above market returns then you could be a leper on a rowboat in the middle of the atlantic and they will swim through shark-infested waters to give you money to manage so there's nothing you need to do other than you know do your work and they will find they will find you trust me and they will want to put money to manage with you so if someone is start starting a fund my advice to them number one i would say what have you done in the past for yourself and because that is i think the basic proof that you are a good manager is if you have actually accumulated some wealth if that is true that you have accumulated some wealth i think then the second piece becomes relatively easy people will look at that and be interested in giving you money to manage but if that is not the case then you focus on friends family and foods and amongst the three the foods are the most important so i would go with the zero six twenty five and the zero six twenty five should not be a problem if you are independently wealthy and it gives you a competitive advantage because a lot of my investors will not put money with managers who charge you know one or two percent management fees because they like that alignment of interest so that's that's what i would recommend thanks a lot sure thanks a lot thank you and if you want to go next i hope i'm pronouncing that correct hi manish i wanted to ask during your first couple of years running propriety funds you had i imagine investors who thought a lot like you or who believed in your frame of investing how about the next 10 to 20 years how did you find you know a choir that sang to your team i'm sorry can you just repeat that so the first  so so the first couple of years your first early investors in propriety funds they the investors probably thought a lot like you and believed in your value investing framework  how did you get more investors who thought in the same way what that journey  i think i think that's relatively straightforward so if you are if you own a mcdonald's and you put a sign of mcdonald's outside and when you go in this restaurant you serve fine french food you're going to have a very confused customer base who may not come back because they wouldn't understand what's going on and if you have a fine french restaurant and inside is you're serving mcdonald's hamburgers your customers again get confused so i would say that what my experience has been is that the behavior and the way you interact with the investors will drive who comes to the restaurant and what ends up happening is that if if you have the right kind of you know rules and behavior you will naturally attract the right kind of investor so i am a weird guy if you got to know me better you would know that i'm quite weird so one of the things i decided when i was independently wealthy is i just want to do things my way you know what's the point of being independently wealthy if you can't do things your way so i don't like a lot of human contact generally human contact is not that exciting and i don't like to have a lot of conversations with potential investors or even current investors etc i just like to be in a room by myself that's quite exciting for me so i set up some rules okay my rules were if you wanted to invest in paprika funds i was not available to talk to you and i wasn't available to really interact with you there was a lot of information on our website you could read that and if you were excited about what you read we could send you subscription documents and you could join the funds and if you wanted to meet the fund manager or have conversations or have a quarterly call or any of those things well that just wasn't going to happen so i opened a mcdonald's i put up a sign which said mcdonald's and when you went in they were just great big bags that you could have so what happened is that under these rules under these weird rules certain things happen and i actually i can only say that because now i have the experience of seeing who walked into the mcdonald's i've seen for 20 years who walked in and who just looked at the sign and the rules and just walked on right so the people who walked in to the restaurant were almost all principles they were almost no agents right so first of all when people are coming to invest is the people who have their own money and their their agents were so for example a university endowment it's run by agents it's not their money and so when a university endowment would look at forbiddens they would call and say can we have a conversation you know we have n billion under management and my assistant would just give them the website link and id and password and say wow and very quickly they would move on because they're not getting what they need right and so so what ended up happening is because of so the way you set up your rules and what you put on the outside of this restaurant the signage is important i ended up with an investor base which is principles it's their own money and the second aspect of the demographic i have is most of them are first-generation entrepreneurs so most of them are not you know third generation wealth coming down these are individuals who basically for the most part created their own business created some wealth and the other thing because i was not willing to have conversations these were people who were willing to do research on their own so they were willing to go into a website look at it i mean i have investors in new zealand who i have never met we have never had a phone call and they've wired several million dollars to us after going to our website the good news is i'm not a fraud and that money is actually there and everything's fine no problem and to my investors in new zealand thank you very much i love having you and we have an annual meeting once a year and people show up people show up from all over the world for the annual meeting it's great and usually i'm meeting some of the investors for the first time there are lots and lots of investors i have lots of families i have that i have never met and i have never had a phone call but i still love them i want to let them know that i do love them so i think that whatever rules you set up and whatever your signage is is going to naturally drive who enters your funds and i really like the cast of characters we have around like you know i know 350 or 400 families in paper ifans i love these guys i love these families they're wonderful and i'm happy that we've been able to do something so it's worked out very well and david if you'd like to go hi and thank you again so much for meeting with us particularly given how exclusive it is to be able to meet with you i feel very much more lucky to be able to meet with you and you must have one of the best websites in the whole wide world so thank you very much my question though is more about stock picking the the way that our club operates is we have sector heads and the sector heads have their analysts who help them who support them and then after they come up with an idea for a stock that idea is pitched to the club and we vote on it and a majority through a majority vote it goes into the fun my question though is there is a universe with hundreds of thousands of publicly traded securities out there what suggestions would you have for young people like us to just put our finger up there and say this is a good area to invest in or this is a good stock to invest in how do you sort of get your head around that universe of publicly traded securities available  well that's a that's a good question i mean i think the first thing is that you don't need to have an opinion on most of these securities in fact i would say you don't need to have an opinion on 99 of them so the first thing i would do is try to figure out what are the parts of the world that i understand what's my circle of competence do i understand you know the banking sector really well or do i understand apple really well what do i understand really well if you understand something really well by definition you would know what that business is worth and then then you know what it's worth and you know what it's being priced at and you can see whether there's a delta between the two so i would not focus on you know looking at this whole great big white world i would just look at you know things that you know about things that you understand products that you use just things around you that make sense you read the newspaper something intrigues you about something and you you dive in and dig in and and then take it from there so that's how i would go about it i would not really try to complicate it more than that and as a follow-up after you've identified a company that you think is interesting how do you decide if it's worth pulling the trigger and executing on that particular company well i think it should get to a point where you should be able to explain to a nine-year-old in about five sentences why you're gonna be drowning in wealth after investing in that business and why there's no chance you would lose any money and so if you can explain to it to eight or nine year old in a paragraph of this then i think you got it thank you all right perfect thank you and jesus you had another question  if i may and we have time i see it also covered it this year has changed a lot of things the way we do the way we buy the way we interact with other people we connect we do business one of the things that are really struggling is the how we purchase things you know and it it surprised me that it appears that you opened recently a position in certain age growth properties specializing commercial property what are you seeing there that other investors don't see i see other investors running away from commercial retail rate and commercial properties and you are going into that sector is there anything else despite the price well i'll mostly doubt your question but i would say this that the stock market is like a theater and in the theater the rule is that every seat has to be occupied or in other words if there is a business and it has 10 million shares outstanding every one of those shares has to be owned by somebody there's no shares just sitting there with nobody so the seats in the theater are fully occupied and they always have to be fully occupied and now there is a fire in the theater or someone yells fine so when you hear the word fire you want to just get up from your seat and go to the exit you don't want to really ask any questions whether there's a real fire or a fake fire you just say i am out of here but there's a rule in this theater which is different from the other theaters that you can only leave your seat if you find somebody else to take your seat because that share has to be held by someone right so it's not like you can just leave the theater and the seat will be empty no the rule is you can leave the teeth but you need to find somebody outside who will come and sit inside the theater and so you know you go outside the theater and say listen it's okay the movie is great there's a little bit of fire and there's some smoke but it don't really worry about it it's really probably nothing but i'm giving you my ticket which cost me ten dollars please you can have it for 50 cents do you want to take it and the guy says you know not really he says listen please take it for 25 cents okay so there is a clearing price for the ticket because you can't leave till somebody sits in your seat and so now we will answer that question on sarotaj at some point when i don't own it okay sometime in the future i will not own it i would just say that before covet cereta was trading at 35 or 40 a share and there was suddenly a fire and instantly the stock went to six to nine dollars a share so that was the price at which somebody else was willing to buy that seat me being one of them and i own 1 8 little more than 1 8 of all the seats in that theater so i must like the movie it may be a little warm under my seat but the movie is great amazing answer amazing answer thank you very much i'm sorry if i put you in a difficult oh no no i'm glad you enjoyed my answer and i hope i can give you a more richer answer in the future i will get that answer in the future yes absolutely great thank you and brendan you had a question  manish thank you for coming today it's we've learned a lot and know the funds taken a lot from this to build off the last two questions talking about feeling the fire under this sheet when we take a position i'm having a personal problem with this as well as the fun could also work on this taking a position that's grown to a sizeable portion of the portfolio and then learning when to pair back that position or even exit the trade whether it's reach intrinsic value or it's just become a large part of the portfolio that's starting to adversely affect the diversification so my question is when do you realize you should start pairing back your trade and start taking some profits in a position well the walton family hasn't done that for 51 years and many many founders have not done that so the question i would ask and this i think i think i think you would get a lot out of next leaps letters is the question i would ask is is the business getting better so i wouldn't really focus so much on the valuation so my mindset would be that of a founder that i'm like a founder or a family that owns the business and i'm not particularly concerned that it's worth 100 and it's trading at 120. that is i think a relevant data point for me what i'm concerned about is what is the quality of the business and is the business getting better now if the valuation is completely egregious right i mean like you know snowflake or something you know this thing is trading at 80 times sales or something well that's a different conversation okay but i wouldn't be particularly concerned if there was a good business and i think it should be worth 20 times earnings and it's trading at 30 times i don't think the factor there would be that it's i can find something at you know 12 times earnings then do that so there's tax implications for that in most accounts i used to be an investor who used to look at intrinsic value sell and go back and buy something else i think that if i own a great business that's the question i want to ask is the business getting better and if the answer is yes and the pricing is not extremely egregious i'm just doing nothing great thank you okay and the other thing is i think that this pairing back issue is that we should be comfortable with 95 in one stock so if if you made a great investment in amazon 10 or 15 years ago and it just grew and grew and grew and it became like 80 90 portfolio and you look at amazon today is the business getting better absolutely it's getting better by the day and is it egregiously overvalued i don't think so you know so my answer would be if it was 95 of my portfolio and i owned it for 15 years i would just do nothing you know jeff is telling me it's day one it's still day one so we'll wait till at least day two when he says it's day two i'll look at it all right great thank you and adam you had a question yes thank you clayton thank you sir for this very interesting presentation i was just wondering if you could briefly talk a little bit more about you you mentioned you alluded to correlation and whether you had a view on what's a good number of stocks in a portfolio i would say if you talk to charlie he would say that you don't need more than four or five stocks i'd say if you were running your own money probably that's a good answer you know four or five stocks is good for iphones usually i don't put more than 10 into something it's other people's money you know the guy in new zealand we got to take care of him so  i mean but i don't think one should own 30 stocks or 20 stocks i think i think you know 10 is plenty thank you great thank you and isaac you had a question yes thank you manish for coming to speak with us i've really enjoyed listening to this i have a question regarding level of certainty and how much information you need to know before entering a physician and if what i've found is if you in my own personal investing is there's a certain point between you know getting comfortable as a position and knowing everything when i'm comfortable starting to invest and i continue doing my research and you're never going to get to understanding 100 of a business but i always aim to get to a level where i'm comfortable knowing it and i'm just curious to hear your thoughts on how much information you need to understand for your level of conviction to be a buy  i think there's a couple of approaches you know i think what i noticed with someone like lilu or even with nick sleep is they tend to start these positions small and they don't seem to have a problem with buying as it goes up in price they don't have a problem paying more i think i think lilu has spoken that he believes that risk factors go down as you own the business for longer because you know more about it and and so even even though you're paying a higher price your amount of knowledge is just vastly superior and the other thing i what i found to be true is you really understand a business only after you own it so it has to be real you're not having real money in a portfolio that's when you really start to understand it so it could be just fine i mean i think when nick sleep was running his portfolio he would have 30 stocks but you know seven or eight stocks would make up 70 80 and then there was a farm team on the side which is you know a bunch of small positions which might move up to you know the major leagues at some point or might not so you could take that approach i haven't taken that approach in my portfolio but i think that's a valid approach and that's fine so you could do a couple of different ways thank you elliot it looks like you have a question oh  i just want to ask you about like so from your own standpoint like when you come back investing particularly for those perspective investors who want to be more active within the emerging market especially for those type of companies with less disclosure capacity less regulatory disclosure and also more volatile business nature when you're going to do those big negative value investing what are the key suggestions you will give to investors especially right now they may not have enough like access to those information from your own standpoint when what's the risk or suggestion you will give well i would say that you should be willing to take a pass if you're not getting all the data you need all the data to be comfortable there's such a large range of businesses that you could invest in that if if you're looking at a company and you don't have enough information i mean i think disclosures can be low in a business but your understanding can be really good so i don't think it's a direct correlation between disclosure and understanding the key is so for example it could be there's an emerging market business where you are a consumer of the product and you understand the product really well and you also have a very good understanding of the economics of the business around that product so if you understand the product and you know the vote and all of that then the disclosures the company is doing is not that relevant because i think you have a great and the other thing is to look at the track record you know it should show up in the in the historic track record and so i think that i would not want to invest i don't invest anything until i have great conviction and you can get great conviction even if the business is not providing a lot of detail if you really understand it well but if you don't get that great conviction i think you should have the discipline to move on all right thank you so much sure all right and it looks like we have time for one last question at david you want to go  hi so i just have an additional question what what's been worrying you these days in the market obviously the market has been on a tear since since i guess june may but what what has been worrying you lately you know so there's a saying if wealth is lost nothing is lost if health is lost something is lost and if character is lost everything is lost i don't think i've ever been concerned about the markets or wealth or anything so i think what is happening in the market for the most part is it relevant you know even during the financial crisis i think that my portfolio was down like two thirds and later my wife was telling me that she didn't realize that was going on because she didn't see any change in my demeanor or anything you know there was no change in fact those are good times because you get a lot of good opportunities to do things i am never really interested or focused on the market i'm really looking at individual businesses and sometimes these individual gold businesses go on sale because of specific circumstances around that business some temporary hiccups and sometimes they go on sale because everyone's panicked and every theater is on fire you know it's not just one theater on fire it's like a hundred theaters on fire and such you know so then then those tickets really get discounted  so i think you know it's too minotia to worry yourself about these things
