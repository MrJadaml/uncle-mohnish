asian indians make up about 1 percent of the population of the united states about three million people
of these three million a relatively small subsection is from the indian state of gujarat the birthplace of mahatma gandhi
and a very small subsection of gujaratis the patels are from a tiny area in southern gujarat
less than one in five hundred americans is a patel
it is thus amazing that over half of all the motels in the entire country are owned and operated by patels
what is even more stunning is that there were virtually no patels in the united states just 35 years ago
they started arriving as refugees in the early 1970s without much in the way of education or capital
their heavily accented broken english speaking skills did not improve their prospects either
from that severely handicapped beginning with all the odds stacked against them the patels triumphed
patels as a group today own over 40 billion in motel assets in the united states pay over 725 million a year in taxes and employ nearly a million people
how did this small impoverished ethnic group come out of nowhere and end up controlling such vast resources
there is a one word explanation dhandho
dhandho pronounced dhun doe is a gujarati word
dhan comes from the sanskrit root word dhana meaning wealth
dhan dho literally translated means endeavors that create wealth
the street translation of dhandho is simply business
what is business if not an endeavor to create wealth
however if we examine the low risk high return approach to business taken by the patels dhandho takes on a much narrower meaning
we have all been taught that earning high rates of return requires taking on greater risks
dhandho flips this concept around
dhandho is all about the minimization of risk while maximizing the reward
the stereotypical patel naturally approaches all business endeavors with this deeply ingrained riskless dhandho framework for him it is like breathing
dhandho is thus best described as endeavors that create wealth while taking virtually no risk
not only should every entrepreneur seek to learn from the patel dhandho framework but also the primary audience for this tome investors and allocators of capital
dhandho is capital allocation at its very finest
if an investor can make virtually risk free bets with outsized rewards and keep making the bets over and over the results are stunning
dhandho is how the patels have exponentially compounded their net worths over the past 30 odd years
i am getting ahead of myself
sit back relax grab a cool one and mellow out
you are about to begin a remarkable journey one that i hope is as rewarding and profitable for you as it has been for me and generations of patel businessmen
gujarat lies along the arabian sea with a large desirable coastline and several natural harbors
the tropic of cancer cuts right through the state
over the centuries it has always been an ideal location for trade with neighboring asian and african countries it has served as a melting pot of many different cultures over its rich history
the parsis fleeing religious persecution in iran landed in gujarat as refugees in the twelfth century and were warmly received
similarly the ismailis arrived in the first half of the nineteenth century from iran
for several centuries gujaratis were very used to traveling to and trading with their asian and african neighbors
patels originally were known as patidars loosely translated as landlords
most villages in gujarat had a patidar appointed by the ruler who was responsible for collecting land taxes providing security and running a streamlined farming operation
in medieval times these patidars were chosen on the basis of their savvy management and farming skills
patels usually had large families and as the land was subdivided into smaller and smaller fragments for each son farming became a tough way to make a buck
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ismailis and patels from gujarat migrated in significant numbers to countries like uganda in east africa
they went as traders or as indentured laborers to help build the railroads
the patels and the ismailis have been a very entrepreneurial community for centuries and over the ensuing decades with their soon to be revealed dhandho techniques they came to control a large proportion of the businesses in uganda
general idi amin came to power in uganda as a dictator in 1972
he declared that africa was for africans and that non africans had to leave
amin was not a big fan of the patels who controlled most of his economy
the fact that most of these non africans like the patels and the ismailis were born in uganda had been there for generations had no other home and had all their businesses and property in uganda meant nothing to amin
for him it was simple africa was for africans
amin revoked the residency permits of all asians regardless of whether they had any natural homeland to return to
the ugandan state seized all their businesses and nationalized them with no compensation to the owners
a total of 70 000 gujaratis were thus stripped of virtually all their assets and thrown out of the country toward the end of 1972
the world had several hot spots in 1972 and 1973 that had a significant impact on the future destiny of these orphaned patels
with the recent formation of bangladesh in 1971 and the war with pakistan over its independence india was already reeling from a very severe refugee crisis
millions of impoverished bangladeshi refugees had poured into india
as a result the indian government refused to recognize the indian origin population being expelled from uganda as having any right to enter india
amin has patel expulsion also coincided with the tail end of the vietnam war and the united states was dealing with a large influx of vietnamese refugees at the time
president nixon and secretary of state kissinger were well briefed on the ugandan situation and were sympathetic to the plight of the patels but were limited in the number of indian origin refugees they could accept
being members of the commonwealth the vast majority of the patels and ismailis were allowed to settle in england and canada
a few thousand families were also accepted by the united states as refugees
the first few patels who arrived in the united states went into the motel business
the thousands that arrived later followed the lead of the pioneers and also became motel operators
why motels
and why did virtually all of them go into the same industry
if we examine the history of ethnic groups migrating to alien lands we notice a pattern in chicago many of the early irish immigrants became police officers while most housemaids were polish
in new york city koreans dominate the deli and grocery business chinese run many of the city s laundries and sikhs and pakistanis drive most of the cabs
it is a bizarre sight but most of the rental car staff at california s san jose international airport consists of older sikhs turbans and all
there is a large population of eastern european cab drivers in vegas and most of the prostitutes in dubai are of eastern european or russian origin
the reason we end up with concentrations of ethnic groups in certain professions is because role models play a huge role in how humans pick their vocations
if someone looks like me has had a similar upbringing belongs to the same religious order has attended a similar school and is making a good living it naturally has a huge impact when i am trying to decide my calling in life
tall inner city african american kids routinely see tall african american males playing for the nba and leading very enviable lives
they are also aware that the childhood of these nba stars in many cases is pretty similar to their own present circumstance
it serves as a huge motivator to sharpen their basketball playing skills
that still begs the question why did the first wave of patels who entered the united states go into the motel business
why not delis laundromats or drug stores
why motels
and why not just find a job
part of the answer lies in another demographic shift that was underway in the early 1970s in the united states
after world war ii there was a huge buildout of suburbia and the interstate highway system
the automobile had become a middle class staple and american family owned motels popped up all along the newly built interstates
the 1973 arab oil embargo and misguided american economic policies price and wage controls led to a deep recession across the country
motels are heavily dependent on discretionary spending
the recession coupled with rationed and sky high gas prices led to huge drops in occupancy
many small nondescript motels were foreclosed by banks or went on sale at distressed prices
at the same time the kids of these old motel owner families were coming of age and saw plenty of opportunity outside of the motel business and left in droves to seek their fortune elsewhere
papa patel it is 1973
papa patel has been kicked out of kampala uganda and has landed as a refugee in anywheretown usa with his wife and three teenage kids
he has had about two months to plan his exit and has converted as much of his assets as he could into gold and other currencies and has smuggled it out of the country
it is not much a few thousand dollars
with a family to feed he is quickly trying to become oriented to his alien surroundings
he figures out that the best he can do with his strange accent and broken english speaking skills will be a job bagging groceries at minimum wage
papa patel sees this small 20 room motel on sale at what appears to be a very cheap price and starts thinking
if he buys it the motivated seller or a bank will likely finance 80 percent to 90 percent of the purchase price
his family can live there as well and their rent will go to zero
his cash requirement to buy the place is a few thousand dollars
between himself and his close relatives he raises about 5 000 in cash and buys the motel
a neighborhood bank and the seller agree to carry notes with the collateral being a lien on the motel
as one of the first patels in the united states dahyabhai patel succinctly put it it required only a small investment and it solved my accommodation problem because my family and i could live and work there 1 papa patel figures the family can live in a couple of rooms so they have no rent or mortgage to pay and minimal need for a car
even the smallest motel needs a 24 hour front desk and someone to clean the rooms and do the laundry at least four people working eight hours each
papa patel lets all the hired help go
mama and papa patel work long hours on the various motel chores and the kids help out during the evenings weekends and holidays
dahyabhai patel reflecting on the modus operandi during the early days said i was my own front desk clerk my own carpenter my own plumber maid electrician washerman and what not 2 with no hired help and a very tight rein on expenses papa patel s motel has the lowest operating cost of any motel in the vicinity
he can offer the lowest nightly rate and still maintain the same or higher profitability per room than his predecessor and competitors
as a result he has higher occupancy and is making super normal profits
his competitors start seeing occupancy drop off and experience severe pressure on rates
their cost structures prohibit them from matching the rates offered by the patel motel leading to a spiraling reduction in occupancy and profits
the stereotypical patel is a vegetarian and leads a very simple life
most restaurants in the united states in the 1970s do not serve vegetarian meals so eating at home is all the more attractive and much cheaper for patel families
they are busy with the motel day and night so they have little time for recreational activities
as a result the total living expenses for this family are abysmally low
with a single beater car no home mortgage rent or utilities and zero commute eating out or spending on vacations or entertainment of any type papa patel s family lives quite comfortably on well under 5 000 per year
prices are far lower in the 1970s the minimum wage is just 1 60
the best papa and mama patel could hope for is total annual earnings of about 6 000 per year if they both take up jobs and work full time
if they buy a 20 room motel at a distressed price of 50 000 with about 5 000 in cash and the rest financed even at rates of 12 to 13 per day and 50 percent to 60 percent average occupancy the motel will generate about 50 000 in annual revenue
in the early 1970s with treasuries yielding about 5 percent an owner or most banks will be delighted to finance the motel purchase at a 10 percent to 12 percent interest rate with a lien on the property
mr
patel has annual interest expenses of about 5 000 principal payments of 5 000 and another 5 000 to 10 000 in out of pocket expenses for motel supplies maintenance and utilities
total expenses are thus under 20 000
even if the family spends another 5 000 a year for living expenses a grand sum in 1970 papa patel nets over 15 000 a year after all taxes and all living expenses
if he had borrowed the 5 000 from a fellow patel he has it fully repaid in four months
he could even elect to pay off the mortgage on the motel in just three years
the annual return on that 5 000 of invested capital is a stunning 400 percent 20 000 in annual returns from the investment 15 000 in cash flow and 5 000 in principal repayment
if he borrows the 5 000 from a fellow patel the return on invested capital is infinite zero dollars in and 20 000 a year out
that is all fine and dandy you might say but what if the business does not work out
what if it fails
for this first motel purchase papa patel not only has to give a lien on the property but most likely also a personal guarantee to the lender as well
however papa patel has only 5 000 or less to his name so the personal guarantee is meaningless
if he is unable to make the payments the bank can take over the property but he has virtually no assets outside of the motel
the bank has no interest in taking over the motel and running it it has no such competency
it will be very hard for the bank to sell a money losing motel and cover their note
it is very simple if a patel can not make the motel run profitably no one can
the bank s best option is to work with papa patel to make the motel profitable so the bank is likely to renegotiate terms and try to help papa patel get back on track
they might defer principal and interest payments for a few months until conditions improve
and they might raise the interest rate to offset the pain they are enduring
it is net net papa patel still runs the motel the family still lives there and he works as hard and as smart as he can to make it he has no choice
it is make it work or go bust and homeless
remember this is an existing business with a very stable business model and a long history of cash flow and profitability
it is not rocket science
it is a simple business where the low cost provider has an unassailable competitive advantage and no one can run it any cheaper than papa patel
the motel business ebbs and flows with the economy
eventually conditions are likely to become better the bank is made current on payments and everyone is happy most of all papa patel
let us look at this investment as a bet
there are three possible outcomes
first the 5 000 investment yields an annualized rate of return of 400 percent
let us assume this continues for just 10 years and the business is sold for the same price as it was bought 50 000
this is like a bond that pays 300 percent interest a year with a final interest payment in year 10 of 900 percent
this equates to a 21 bagger an annualized return of well over 50 percent for 10 years
assuming a 10 percent discount rate the discounted cash flow dcf stream is shown in table 1 1
second the economy goes into a severe recession and business plummets for several years
the bank works with mr
patel and renegotiates loan terms as described earlier
mr
patel has a zero return on his investment for five years and then starts making 10 000 a year in excess free cash flow when the economy recovers and booms 200 percent return every year after five years
the motel is sold in year 10 for the purchase price
now we have a bond that pays zero interest for five years then 200 percent for five years and a final interest payment of 900 percent see table 1 2
this equates to a seven bagger an annualized return of over 40 percent for 10 years
third the economy goes into a severe recession and business plummets
mr
patel can not make the payments and the bank forecloses and mr
patel loses his investment
the annualized return is 100 percent
these three outcomes cover virtually the entire range of possibilities
assume the likelihood of the first option is 80 percent the second is 10 percent and the third is 10 percent
these are very conservative probabilities as we are assumtable 1 1 discounted cash flow dcf analysis of the best case for papa patel present value mm of year free cash flow future cash flow excess cash 0 1 15 000 13 636 2 15 000 12 397 3 15 000 11 270 4 15 000 10 245 5 15 000 9 314 6 15 000 8 467 7 15 000 7 697 8 15 000 6 998 9 15 000 6 361 10 15 000 5 783 10 sale price 50 000 19 277 total 111 445 ing a one in five chance of the motel performing far worse than projected even though it was bought on the cheap at a distressed sale price and run by a best of breed savvy low cost operator
we have unrealistically assumed there is no rise in the motel s value or in nightly rates over 10 years
even then the probability weighted annualized return is still well over 40 percent
the expected present value of this investment is about 93 400 0 8 111 445 0 1 42 812
from papa patel s perspective there is a 10 percent chance of losing his 5 000 and a 90 percent chance of ending up with over 100 000 with an 80 percent chance of ending up with 200 000 over 10 years
this sounds like a no brainer bet to me
if you went to a horse race track and you were offered 90 percent odds of a 20 times return and a 10 percent chance of losing your money would you take that bet
heck yes
you would make that bet all day long and it would make sense to bet a table 1 2 discounted cash flow dcf analysis of the below average case for papa patel present value mm of year free cash flow future cash flow excess cash 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 6 15 000 5 645 7 15 000 5 131 8 15 000 4 665 9 15 000 4 240 10 15 000 3 854 10 sale price 50 000 19 277 total 42 812 very large portion of your net worth with those spectacular odds
this is not a risk free bet but it is a very low risk high return bet
heads i win tails i do not lose much
the skeptic in you remains unconvinced that the risk here is low
you might say that there is still the very real possibility of going broke if you bet all you have like papa patel has done
papa patel does bet it all on one bet but he has an ace in the hole
if the lender forecloses and he loses the motel he and his wife can take up jobs bagging groceries work 60 hours a week instead of 40 and maximize their savings
at the 1973 minimum wage of 1 60 they earn 9 600 a year
after taxes they can easily sock away 2 000 to 4 000 a year
after two years papa patel could step up to the plate and buy another motel and make another bet
the odds of losing this bet twice in a row are 1 in 100
and the odds that it pays off at least once are roughly 99 percent
when it does pay off it is over a 20 fold return
that is an ultra low risk bet with ultra high returns one very much worth making heads i win tails i do not lose much
with such high cash flow coming in papa patel is soon flush with cash
he still has a very modest lifestyle
his eldest son comes of age in a few years and he hands over the motel to him
the family buys a modest house and goes hunting for the next motel to buy
this time they buy a larger motel with 50 rooms
the family no longer lives at the motel but still does most of the work with little in the way of hired help
the formula is simple fixate on keeping costs as low as possible charge lower rates than all competitors drive up the occupancy and maximize the free cash flow
finally keep handing over motels to up and coming patel relatives to run while adding more and more properties
there is a snowball effect here and over time we end up with these amazing statistics half of all motels in the united states are under patel ownership
having fully cornered the motel market the patels have begun buying higher end hotels and have delved into a number of businesses where they can apply their lowest cost operator model for unassailable competitive advantage gas stations dunkin donuts franchises convenience stores 7 elevens and the like
some have even branched out into developing high end time share condominiums
the snowball continues to roll down this very long hill becoming bigger over time
