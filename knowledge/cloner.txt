mohnish sure
i always tell people who are introducing me that the thing that they
should not skip in the introduction is that something i am very proud of is i got
a lifetime ban at a casino in vegas that told me i could never play blackjack at
their casino
i told them i m not counting cards because normally you ban
people who are counting cards
they said yes it took us about six months to
figure it out and yes we agree you are not counting cards but we cannot win
against your system
i asked them if they would give me a letter a graduation
certificate and they said no you are just banned
anyway i have been a
student of buffett munger and graham now for almost 30 years
i heard about
warren buffett for the first time in 1994 and it opened a big new world for me
i had never bought a stock before that never really worked in the industry and
i was intrigued and fascinated as i read the first few biographies that had come
out on buffett then the berkshire letters and then the buffett partnership
letters
i just kept reading and learning and started to follow that approach in
94
about five years later i had some friends who asked me to manage money
formally for them
the small amount eight guys a total of a million dollars
that
is what led to the formation of pabrai investment funds
i did not plan at that
time for it to become a full time vocation
i thought it would be just something
on the side for me and my friends
i manage about 900 million now
it is mostly
high net worth families
the funds have been around for about 24 years
over
the years surprisingly warren and charlie both became friends which was not
expected
we always think of them as icons never to be touched met or
interacted with so that was interesting
i used to play quite a bit of bridge with
charlie on fridays at the la country club which he does not do now because
he is not so mobile
that is kind of a quick backdrop
interviewer before we get into the world of probabilities and kind of ask you about
investing we came across your dakshana foundation if i have pronounced
that correctly
can you tell us a little bit about that before we go into the rest
of the interview
mohnish yes sure
just yesterday there was news in the new york times that chuck
feeney had passed away
i do not know if you guys are familiar with chuck
feeney but there is a book called the billionaire who wasn t and it is a great
book to read
chuck feeney over his lifetime gave away about eight billion
dollars or more to charity
he tried to do it anonymously
he went to great
lengths to make sure that the recipients did not know who the person giving
the money was
his objective was to die with zero
he was 92 when he passed
away
a few years back maybe three or four years back he moved into a simple
rental apartment in san francisco
he was down to his last two million
he
pretty much accomplished what he sought to do which was to die with zero
that is what i am trying to do live up to the chuck feeney standard and die
with zero
i am going to be leaving planet earth on june 11th 2054 about 30
years and a few months from now
one day before that which is june 10th
2054 i hope to be down to a hundred dollars
there is one engine which is
compounding assets and increasing wealth and there is another engine
dakshana foundation which is focused on giving it away
i started the dakshana foundation about 17 years ago because i knew that
trying to start this when i was 70 or 80 years old i would not have much energy
to do anything
we started small about 17 years ago and the idea was to
become good at giving money away
giving money away effectively is far more
difficult than making money
dakshana foundation has done far better than i
expected
it has been very effective at giving
we identify very poor but
brilliant kids in india who come from families which are typically making well
under a hundred dollars a month three to four dollars a day or less
some of
them make two dollars a day
what we do is we take over their education for
about two years from 16 to 18 and we get them to the iits which are like the
mit of india or aims like the harvard medical school of india
it does a full reset
for the family and the community because their income levels go to world
standards at that point
currently dakshana foundation is spending about
three million dollars a year
the objective is that we just started a program of
about 13 million capex in the next three years to increase our capacity
the idea
would be that hopefully if the compounding engine works in the next three
decades then the giving engine needs to work even better because as we
compound money then i need to amp it up like mr
feeney
that is what
dakshana foundation is all about
i like to play games i like to play blackjack
dakshana foundation is a game
pabrai investment funds is a game
bridge is
a game
i just like to play games
interviewer that is nice
you have mentioned in the past that correct me if i am wrong
when you were growing up your dad was an entrepreneur and you would see
him many times start new businesses and those businesses not doing very
well and then he would start all over again
we thought that it would be nice
to start our conversation about how that experience shaped risk for you
mohnish that is a great question
my dad was exceptional at identifying offering gaps in
the market
he was good at looking at what was going on around him and
saying this product or this service does not exist and i know that if i create
this product or service it is likely to do well
his hit rate on those was extremely
high
in india there was no ecosystem of venture capital or anything or even
bank financing for that matter
when he had a startup he repeatedly started
with zero and he was almost always right about the opportunity
he was very
good at identifying those gaps that existed
the issue he had was that he was
an eternal optimist and he was in a hurry
once the business got going he
would want to grow it as fast as possible
these businesses typically had a very
thin layer of equity and capital and as much leverage and debt as the banks
would give them
he would constantly be maxing on the leverage to grow as
quickly as possible and the moment the first headwinds would show up and
there would always be headwinds we always have headwinds in business he
would go back to square zero
these businesses just were not built to
withstand even the lightest winds because they were always levered to the hilt
and they would invariably crumble and fail because the ecosystem also was not
there that you could get other financing or someone to give you equity or
something like that
he would go back to square one and amazingly he would
in a few months concoct a new idea and get going again
i saw him do this
repeatedly
he was a very logical engineer a kind of rational thinker
i remember that one time when i was about 10 years old there used to be an
astrologer who used to come to our home on sunday wearing orange robes
with all these marks on his forehead
my father would sit with him and ask him
about the future
the astrologer would give my father various data points of
what was going to happen
then next sunday the astrologer will be back
i
mustered up the courage to go up to my dad and said you got to know that
this guy is full of shit
he does not know anything
we do not have money
everything is gone
you give him money every week and then he shows up the
following week
why would you want to do this
he said when i give him
money and ask him about the future he gives me a very rosy forecast for what
is about to happen next in my life
i suspend reality when he is talking to me
like that
he is the rope
i am at the bottom of a very deep well and i need a
rope to come out of that well
he is my rope because he tells me stories about
new businesses that i am going to create that they are going to prosper and
that things are going to be great
that is my rope to come out of that well not
be depressed and start the next business
that was the experience
the impact it had on me was that i was lucky that my dad was doing well when
it came time for my brother and me to go to college
he wanted us to come to
the us for college and thankfully he could afford it at that time
we came to
the us and i studied engineering
i planned to never ever be an entrepreneur
and never start any business because i had seen these huge durations up and
down and i just did not want that
i thought if i get a good engineering
degree i am going to get a good job and i am always going to be able to have
a job and life is going to be stable
fifteen percent is going to go into my
retirement account into index funds and that is going to grow
my dad visited
me about three years after i started working
he told me that he was
disappointed and that he had all these aspirations of what i might do and here
i was a cog in the wheel of a large company
i told him do you remember my
childhood
do you remember the trauma
he said that was all excitement in
life
we cannot have a boring life
he was able to prevail over me and i moved
i left my job started my first business and then went from there
interviewer that was a great story
we have read the book richer wiser happier by
william green and you profiled in there
the main thing around your profile is
about cloning and how you have made your career out of being a great cloner
can you tell us a little bit about what you were doing when you were cloning
and who the people of your cloning or the subjects of your cloning were
mohnish yes
charlie munger talks about these mental models and cloning is a very
powerful mental model
one of the weird unusual things about humans and i
still do not know why this is the case with humans is that most humans have a
strong aversion to cloning
i am not sure where that comes from in evolution
but they think it is beneath them
they almost think it is like copying
moreover
a lot of humans will believe that for example starbucks is such a great idea
but it has already been done or soulcycle is a great idea but it has been done
there is room for many starbucks and there is room for many versions of the
same business
that is the other thing that humans have a false mental model
where they see that someone has done something innovative and they think
that it has been done and there is no opportunity there
we run into some
humans for example if you look at a company like microsoft they spent so
many billions of dollars a year on r d they have got microsoft research which
in several decades more than four decades has produced nothing
they just
keep having these very smart ph d s funded
nothing comes out of that lab
but
what has worked for microsoft is they saw wordperfect and they cloned it and
created word
they saw lotus 1 2 and 3 and created excel
they saw netscape
and created microsoft explorer and now edge
they created bing
you know
what bing stands for but it is not google
all the successes microsoft has had
have come from being an intense cloner
apple invented the mouse apple
copied the mouse from xerox parc labs
microsoft wanted to make the mouse
work in the ms dos and windows world which was a big challenge because
of a very different architecture and they were just dogged about it
finally the
engineers were able to do it they created windows
microsoft is not even a
great clone
windows took 15 or 20 versions before humans could use it and
they still complain
it is not as good as that
even not being that great a cloner
gives you a huge advantage
sam walton with walmart for the first 15 years or 20 years of walmart s
existence there was absolutely nothing new that walmart came up with
it was
a completely cloned model taken from kmart and sears
sam walton spent an
incredible amount of time in his competitive stores
whenever he was traveling
anywhere to see any walmart new locations he was always going into the retail
stores of even small mom and pop competitors
he did not care if they were
big or small or successful or not successful
even from a failing retailer he
would find something that they were doing that he could copy from them
walmart built on that
even a company like starbucks howard schultz looks at
the cafes in italy and says this can play in peoria illinois
he clones it and it
does play
then he went upscale with starbucks reserve and all of that
what i
have found over the decades is that number one most humans for whatever
reason think cloning is beneath them and number two that if you do not
follow that bar it is going to give you a huge leg up in life
dakshana foundation is a cloned model
i found a guy who was doing
something smart
i wanted to fund him but he did not want to scale
then i
asked him do you mind if i copy your model
he said no not at all
i would
help you
pabrai investment funds was cloned from the buffett partnerships
the buffett
partnerships had these unusual rules from 1956 to 1970
he had the greatest
record
when i was starting pabrai investment funds in 1999 it was three
decades after buffett had shut down
in three decades after he shut down what
is arguably the most successful hedge fund ever no one had cloned his model
no one had cloned his fee structure
nobody wanted to do it that way
i was
surprised
i told myself do not be surprised mohnish
this is the way humans
are
they want to leave all these opportunities for you because they do not
want to clone
i have so many investors who will not invest in a fund which
charges a one or two percent management fee
we charge no management
fee and i did not come up with that
i have copied that from warren
you latch
onto a demographic that wants that they want the aligned interest of the
investment manager and it works
i have found in the investments that i have
done well many of those have been cloned
business models have been
cloned the charity has been cloned
i have no original ideas
i am just a
shameless cloner
interviewer i got a follow up to that
in terms of cloning can you ever get to the point
where there are too many cloners
let us take berkshire hathaway for example
back in 1979 there were 20 people or 20 potential cloners who sat there
listening to charlie and warren
then in 2015 there were 44 000 potential
cloners
does it ever get too competitive or is it quite a difficult thing to do
not everyone can be as successful as you have been with cloning for whatever
reason
mohnish now the berkshire annual meetings are online
millions of people listen to
those
all the past meetings are online on buffett cnbc com
it has been in the
public domain for a long time
how many companies do we have that have
cloned the berkshire mark
almost zero because the thing is that cloning does
not work unless you are fanatical about it
sam walton was a fanatic
bill gates
is a fanatic
it is the fanatics who can make this happen not the people who
say i think this is going to work
let me give this a go
if you have that type of
approach you got to go all in
again for whatever reason very few humans are
willing to go all in
it is the intensity of the pursuit
i am not concerned that
cloning is going to stop working because the cat is out of the bag or because i
am doing this podcast
it is going to be alive because many humans have an
aversion to it
the ones who do not have aversion are not fanatical about it
the
other piece is that there are so many areas available for cloning
even if one
area becomes somewhat competitive you have so many other greenfield areas
you can go into
interviewer mohnish correct us if we are wrong
when you started your career with the
very big influence of warren and charlie and this even comes across in your
first book the dhandho investor you were leaning more toward the
benjamin graham side of value investing
however as your career progressed
you seem to have leaned more toward the way that charlie and warren think
about the world
has your perception of risk changed because you have
become more experienced or because it has been influenced by the way that
they look at the world
mohnish ben graham s framework is like bedrock
all of us need that bedrock
the ideas
that the stock is not a piece of paper ownership s stake in a business and the
concept of margin of safety those ideas permeate across whether you are
doing pure grammy investing or going with the buffett or munger approach of
the great businesses they all use this underlying bedrock
the reality of the
situation is that we will make a lot more money by having ownership stakes in
businesses that grow dramatically in value over time
if i bought a business for
40 cents on the dollar and that dollar never grew or it grew at a low rate i might
make two or three times more but if i even paid 60 or 70 cents on the dollar
for a business that was growing 10 15 or 20 a year and i did not pay that
much of a premium for that clearly that is going to be a vastly superior
approach not to mention far more tax efficient because you are not each time
paying uncle sam when you sell and want to look for buying again
the other piece is that there are only so many great ideas one is going to find
over a lifetime
the idea that ben graham had is that you sell a business when
it gets at or near its perceived intrinsic value is at odds with the theories of phil
fisher for example whose perspective was that a great business may surprise
you about its real intrinsic value
intrinsic value is a very difficult thing to figure
out for most businesses
the odds that you may be wrong about an assessment
of intrinsic value can be extremely expensive
the model of giving a great
business a lot of rope which is holding it beyond the point at which you think
it has passed its intrinsic value would be blasphemy in the world of ben
graham
however that approach is extremely important for true wealth
creation over long periods
ben graham himself made most of his money from
owning one business for many decades which was geico
the geico
ownership violated the core principles that he was espousing and teaching
he
just felt like he could not teach the approach to finding or holding a geico as
easily as he could teach a quantitative approach to investing
even in graham s
case half his net worth when he passed away was geico and it had trounced
the s p by seven 8 a year over the long holding period
a swiss army knife
approach to investing is probably best
there are times that we are going to
find anomalies where some grow that much but are cheap and are very stable
and could give us a great return for some time when we do not have a great
business that is obvious to buy
if we are in the fortunate situation of finding a
great business with a great runway then we want to hold onto those for dear
life
this is a big mistake i made for many years where i was buying well below
intrinsic value and selling right at intrinsic value
interviewer mohnish you brought up geico there
that takes us to the subject of
insurance
one element of the berkshire model is insurance and having some
insurance to have a flow to invest
at one point in time you did have an
insurance company but you chose not to take that on in terms of copying the
berkshire model
can you talk a little bit more about owning an insurance
company and why you did not decide to take that on
mohnish that is a good question
warren has repeatedly said that insurance is a
commodity business
it is very difficult
there are some pockets within the large
insurance industry where one can have a sustainable competitor advantage
but by and large the bulk of the industry operates in a commodity like manner
if i am a small business and i am looking for workers compensation insurance
for example i am going to take the low bid
i may take the low bid amongst arated or b plus rated carriers but once a carrier or insurance company is arated the lowest price wins
most insurance companies do not have pricing
power
warren has also said that the average insurance company is a terrible
business
what i realized almost right after i acquired stone trust insurance
was that at the first board meeting it became clear to me that this was not the
place i wanted to be
it was a very commodity business
they were a price taker
and their dumbest competitor was selling price
i felt that rather than go deeper
and deeper getting more and more pregnant with this situation i wanted to
put the toothpaste back in the tube so to speak which is not always easy to
do
toothpaste is only designed to come out of the tube not go back in
i
decided i was going to reverse a course and we decided to sell the insurance
company
we were able to sell it for just about what we bought it for which i
thought was a very good outcome
we were able to return most of the capital
that we had raised back to the investors
the person who bought the insurance
company from me is extremely happy with stone trust
the difference is that
he is a vastly superior operator than i am
i remember that when we sold the
company to him many years ago the premiums we were collecting every year
were about 65 million dollars a year
we sold the business maybe six or seven
years ago
the premiums last year were 50 million dollars
it is down 30 but
the combined ratio of that business is 62 unheard of in the insurance business
francis chu who bought the business from me is an unbelievably great
operator
he has got decades of experience
i would never have been able to
do what he did
it was a win win for everyone
it gave francis a platform to
build the insurance side
the interesting thing i learned and this goes back to
the concept of great businesses and then the mistakes in investing is that
investing is a very forgiving business
even the best investor is probably not
going to be right more than half the time
you are going to have a 50 error
rate
i realized that when we had bought the insurance company that was a
mistake
i thought can we reverse because it is going to consume a lot of brain
cells in an activity that i do not want to particularly be focusing on
that is what
ended up happening
i learned quite a bit
i am very grateful for the experience
being able to see the insurance company from the inside they were very good
people
to be able to see the claims at an individual claim level and kind of
seeing how the sausage is made if you will has been a great experience for
me
it taught me a lot and i am sure it can help in the future
even in the case
of berkshire hathaway charlie munger said a few years back that in the very
distant future insurance may be a small business at berkshire
it would not
surprise me that when ajit jain is no longer running things they may elect to
run off that business because i have not heard of them having a second ajit
a
lot of that business only works because there is an ajit just like stone trust only
works
after all there is francis chu
these unusual insurance operators are
very rare
it is a difficult field
interviewer can i ask about that
if francis was fantastic on the underwriting side was
there any chance for you to partner and you be on the investment side and he
would be on the insurance side in a similar way that they have a berkshire
mohnish well we are old too soon and wise too late
when francis was buying the
business from me he begged me to keep a stake
he said mohnish i want you
to keep 20 25 whatever you want
let us do this together
because i had
seen this business up close i probably underestimated what francis was all
about
if he made that offer to me again i would take it
at the time he
repeatedly kept asking me because there were earnouts
we had our future
payments based on how the business performed
each time he made an earnout payment to us because the business performed extremely well
again he
asked me do you want to roll this into a stake
and i kept saying no
francis
is an exceptional underwriter and operator and a good investor but he is an
example of a guy who has always stayed with graham
he is a classic graham
investor
in a situation where francis is the operator on the insurance side and
someone like me is on the investment side we would do even better
it would
do very well
that would be a good marriage
part of the reason it would be a
good marriage is because he is such a great guy
in terms of trust chemistry
and competence we would have a lot of fun with that
we are both young
it
might happen at some point
interviewer i would have thought that the reason why you at the time thought that it was
not going to work out was more related to how regulation has changed over
the decades
that might limit your capacity to do that great business in the way
that they were able to do it with berkshire
is that a misunderstanding
mohnish well berkshire has some very subtle aspects of its insurance business that are
not available to most other insurance companies
insurance is regulated by the
state in the us
the regulatory framework for insurers based in nebraska is
vastly superior to most other states
one of the things i had almost finished
doing before france had bought the business was that i had redomiciled
we
had started the effort to redomicile the business in nebraska because i realized
once i was in the business and i looked at the different state laws that it was
an advantage to be domiciled in nebraska even if you were not writing a lot of
business in nebraska
there are reciprocal arrangements that the different
states have which give nebraska insurers some advantage
i do not know
whether that advantage came about because warren was able to work with
the regulators to change some of the frameworks over the years
the first is
that the state of nebraska has a better regime for insurers who are good at the
investing side
the second big advantage that berkshire has which people do
not understand is the insurance companies berkshire has are heavily
overcapitalized
if a regulator says that if you are writing 100 dollars of
premium i want to see a 100 dollars of equity
in many cases in those
businesses berkshire has 500 dollars of equity
when you have 500 dollar
equity and you are writing a hundred dollars of premium this is the same
situation that now francis finds himself in at stone trust because their
premium volumes have dropped so much and their surplus has increased so
much
the regulator is going to give you a lot of leaving
to give you an
example when berkshire bought the burlington northern railroad normally
just at the highest level what regulators want in terms of an insurance
framework is they want to float invested very conservatively into fixed income
because that is going to be used to pay people in the future
they do not have
a problem with the surplus being invested in equities because that is kind of
the backup for the insurance
in the case of berkshire the regulators in
nebraska have given them the freedom to even invest the float in equities
when berkshire went to them and said look we are going to buy this railroad
and this railroad
you need to think about it like a bond
if you think about the
way the railroad operates and look at the long history of the railroad it is
producing 5 to 10 billion dollars a year in cash flow
it is a bond with a variable
and we are going to put this railroad inside the insurance company
when you
think about the way the float is allocated and the surplus allocated please think
of the railroad portion being part of the float
the nebraska regulators
accepted that
what happened is that they paid about 40 billion dollars or so
for the railroad
if they were to sell the railroad today my guess is it would sell
for something north of 120 or 130 billion dollars
its value has more than tripled
excluding all the huge dividends it has paid out over the years
now the
nebraska regulators love the whole railroad sitting inside because they can see
the value compared to the publicly traded railroads
recently interestingly just
in the last few weeks berkshire did a filing where they showed that they have
moved the railroad out of the insurance company
i know that would have been
a fun conversation with the regulator because the regulator said no no we
like the insurer
we like the railroad and berkshire would have said well look
i got 700 dollars of equity or a 100 dollars of premium
i am still going to be 400
dollars of equity or 400 dollars of premium
it is still like four times what anyone
else has
do you have any concerns
one of the things that buffett did a long
time ago in the eighties they had a lot of trouble with some insurance
operations
some of these things were horrendous
one hundred and thirty
percent combined ratios or 140 combined ratio
they were upside down
these companies were eventually liquidated
they did terribly
they could
never fix them
they liquidated them
what berkshire did at the time when they
liquidated these companies is that the parent company stood behind the
claims which they did not need to do they had no obligation
these companies
were in real trouble horrendous combined ratios
they were going to be
liquidated
their business model did not work
berkshire at the parent level did
not have an obligation to pay off all claims
it was non recourse
the claims are
only to be paid to the extent that those companies had capital but those
companies ran out of capital
what berkshire at the parent company did is they
stood behind those claims and they paid every single one of them
the
regulators believe that in the case of berkshire there is an implicit guarantee
on these claims
it is not an explicit guarantee it is an implicit guarantee
that
is kind of like freddie mac and fannie mae being implicit guarantees of the us
government
the regulators will always look very favorably upon berkshire
hathaway because of that history
other insurance companies do not have that
type of reputation with the regulators
interviewer that is interesting
i am going to change topics a little bit here
you have been
gifted with a mind that is very well suited for math and thinking in terms of
probabilities and that probably has helped your career in the way that you have
made decisions over time
for those who do not have that inclination or who
have been educated to think probabilities what would be the best way for that
person to learn to adopt probabilistic thinking
mohnish probabilistic thinking is very important for investing because everything is
probability
being a good bridge player is a great way to build that probability
muscle so you can have fun
bridge is a very fun game
it is a very easy game to
learn
it probably will not take more than 30 minutes to learn the game and
one cannot master it even in a lifetime
it is a great game to continuously keep
learning
buffett and munger have gained a lot from playing games like bridge
i came to play bridge separately from investing
i played bridge for many years
before i became an investor
it was a coincidence for me that i was playing and
love bridge but that can help the probabilistic thinking
even when one is
studying businesses and studying histories of businesses and trying to
extrapolate where they are going to go and what they are going to be one is
going to see a range of outcomes
that is just the nature of the way the world
works
if one is just good at that type of thinking which games like bridge or
blackjack can give you then you are that much ahead
interviewer this probably ties in with one of our final questions which is about the way that
you run your portfolios
mohnish you famously run very concentrated funds
if
we can go back to the topic that we started with which was around risk how
do you arrive at that decision to run with those concentrated funds
mohnish well if you study the subject the amount of benefit you get in terms of
diversification and reduction of risk starts to go down quickly as you add more
positions
if you had a single stock portfolio that is at the end of the risk curve
but once you are in about four or five positions in different industries you are
already quite diversified
once you take that number up to ten that is a
significant diversified portfolio
but when you take it from 10 to 20 or 30 or 50
now you are hurting yourself because the minimal benefits you would get from
diversification would be more than offset by the lack of knowledge of those
businesses
when we stay very narrow we are going to be at the epicenter of
our circle of competence
we understand those businesses well
as you start
layering on more things and more companies there is going to be a variance in
terms of how well you know the businesses
not knowing the businesses well
enough even in a highly diversified portfolio is risky
from my point of view
once we get past a few names the risk profile does go down
interviewer one thing that has come up on the podcast several times is the idea of
ergodicity
the idea is that there is a difference between your time weighted
returns and just an ensemble average
that has implications for the chance of
ruin over time
something that is on an expected value basis looks like a good
trade to make
if there is a chance of ruin then that may not be as appealing as
you think
if you run with a concentrated number of holdings in your portfolio
there is an increased risk that you have that chance brewing
how have you
thought about managing that risk through your concentrated portfolios
mohnish any number multiplied by zero no matter how big is zero
we do not want to
go there
it is equity investing that a few of the decisions that you are going to
make are going to generate outsize returns
for example if i were to look at
the walton family owning stock in walmart sam walton during his lifetime
and walmart was not very valuable
he distributed the stock to his kids and he
passed away
there have been no waltons running the business for several
decades
there might be one walton on the board but i am not even sure if
that is true anymore
they have all held the stock and it probably makes up 90
95 of their total assets
when you look at it from the outside you will say oh
this is terrible
it is so non diversified
they probably know walmart better than
anything else
if we step away from the public market for a second and look at
founders who create a lot of wealth with successful businesses most of them
are not diversified
in many cases the companies may not even be public
they
may have 90 95 or more of their net worth in a single stock even when the
company is public
they may have a significant portion in a single stock
of
course they can be hurt and we have plenty of cases where they can be hurt
but the other side of the coin is that great investment opportunities are rare
like when you find yourself in the happy position of owning a great business
that is not overpriced
that is a big sin if you start trimming because it is more
than 25 of the pie
i face this issue in real time
we invested in a business in
turkey reysas which was around 3 of the liquidation value when we invested
the market cap was around 20 million dollars or so
the liquidation value was
600 to 800 million dollars
of course it was a no brainer investment and i was
surprised we were able to get a lot of stock
we ended up getting about a third
of the company for about 8 million dollars
reysas now is valued at about 500
600 million dollars and it used to be until a few weeks ago close to 800 million
the value of business today is even higher because they have done a few things
in the last few years
the liquidation value of that business is well beyond a
billion
if i look at intrinsic value and not liquidation value it goes well beyond
that
it makes up a significant portion of some of our funds
every quarter when
i write to my investors they will let them know we have got this issue and i tell
them listen if you are uncomfortable you should get off the bus because we
are not going to lighten up
i cannot justify lightning up reysas when it is
undervalued when it has great management and a lot of great tailwinds and
that comes with risk
but we are not going to find a reysas every two years
that is just not going to happen
anything i replace it with first there will be a
big tax bill but then anything i replace it with is likely to be inferior
the other
thing that has happened is in the last four years of owning it we have gotten
to know the business a lot better than we knew it before we invested
even
though i am not a founder or a person in the management of reysas i consider
it like a business my family owns
if there is a business like walmart that your
family owns it is probably not the best decision to start looking at let me
diversify and this and that
it is a double edged sword
it does come with risks
but one of the things about investing is that if i look at my friend nick sleep in
the uk he was very early in investing in amazon
amazon became a big part of
the portfolio for him and the uk regulators were giving him some grief about
that
he and his partner looked at each other and said we have hundreds of
millions of dollars each we never thought we would have this even anything
close to this
why should we let other people tell us what to do
what if we
returned everyone s money and just managed our own money
then whatever
amazon becomes is nobody s business whatever percentage of the portfolio
nick returns everyone s money
when he returned the money he put
everything in three stocks
he put a third into berkshire a third into costco and
a third into amazon
of course what happened is amazon kept going like the
energizer bunny it never stops
it again became a very large portion of the
portfolio that he was running
it became more than 50 to 60 of the pie
at that
point he got a little antsy about that and sold off half the amazon position
he
bought a company called asos also in the uk which between us is not a good
business
it will never be a good business
from my perspective it is a mistake
for nick to be investing in asos and that is a greater risk than a business like
amazon going to zero
if i look at a business like amazon it is multiple
businesses
it is not a single business
if you look at people like jeff bezos or
andrew jassy what percentage of their net worth is in amazon
my
perspective if i were to be so bold as to critique that effort with nick is he had
a very well diversified portfolio with those three stocks
each one of those
three companies is exceptional
even if one of the three survived he would not
be in the poor house
he would still be fine
if i were him i would just leave
them all alone let them all be
if amazon becomes 80 so be it
that is okay
that is a good thing
interviewer that is interesting
thank you very much
mohnish given the levels of
concentration that you feel comfortable running as per what you just
explained would it not be better for you to run a vehicle with permanent capital
rather than the current structure that you have
mohnish what happens with all of us if we become very successful is the vehicles
eventually become permanent
if i look at nick sleep again it is a permanent
vehicle because it is his own money now
the same thing happened in many
ways to warren buffett with berkshire hathaway
he was such a large portion
of the pie
i m not particularly concerned about this i do not get a lot of
sleepless nights thinking about permanent versus non permanent capital
at
the back of my mind i always feel that if everybody took all the capital away i
still have a decent amount of my capital and if i never managed anyone else s
money i would still have a happy existence
it is possible at some point i could
involuntarily be turned into a permanent capital vehicle
if that happened no
problem
if the investors choose not to have the confidence in having some of
their hard earned assets with you it is a choice they have and they can
continue with their choice and that is perfectly okay
i do not see a big
compelling need or reason to change things from the way i am doing things
right now
i like the families that have invested with me
i like that most of our
assets are first generation entrepreneurs who are still building wealth
few of
them have retired and such
but it is a great mix
if that mix continues for a
while that is okay and if it comes to an end it will not be the end of the world
either way is fine
interviewer if i may ask a follow up question on the turkish example that you provided
before when you are investing outside of the us in places like a marine market
you are running a risk which is not only the business risk itself but you are also
exposed to the currency
turkey has been going through a rough time over the
last two to three years
how do you think about that in the context of what you
were explaining and this subject of ergodicity
mohnish reysas is a good example to study from a currency point of view
before we
invested i fully expected that the turkish lira would get decimated
i expected
absolute clobbering of the lira and it had no impact on the investment decision
because i said if i have a warehouse in a prime location in istanbul with a longterm inflation index lease with amazon carrefour or ikea that has a global
value and that value will prevail
cement has a global value and steel has a
global value
prime real estate in a place like istanbul has a global value
my take
was that even in extreme scenarios of currency decimation we should be okay
what happened is that when we invested in reysas it was five liras to the
dollar
today it is more than 28 liras to the dollar
that is an 80 plus percent
devaluation
in dollars we are up by 20 or 30 x and in lira we are up by infinite
x but who cares about that
there are two other investments i made in turkey
one was a coke bottler and the other was an airport operator
in the case of
the airport operator it was very simple because all their revenues are
contractually in euros
very little of tab airports revenue is in local lira
a lot
of the expenses like staff salaries are in liras
in that case a decimating currency
would give them tailwinds because their costs would go down while their
revenues would stay intact which is exactly what has happened
one of the
things that markets do is stereotype and they use broad brush strokes
turkey
was considered uninvestible it was considered very investor unfriendly
any
place you go to where the currency has a problem most investments are not
going to work well
what i noticed is that the baby got thrown out of the
bathwater
when i sifted through i met with maybe 60 or 70 listed turkish
businesses over the last few years
most of those companies are not invested
they would face real headwinds in this environment but there were a few that
the baby got thrown out irrationally
that is what we are looking for
we are
looking for irrational behavior amongst market participants
i am not so
concerned about the overweight risk of emerging markets or the
overweighting risk of currencies
what one needs is to be a rational investor
and accurately weigh those risks not be paranoid about those situations
in the
case of the coke bottler around 70 of their revenue is not even from turkey
it comes from a dozen other countries
the same with tab airport
even though
their currency is euros a large portion of revenues are coming from outside
turkey
that was excellent because now it is a business listed in istanbul facing
all the negative perceptions of investors leading to ridiculous and irrational
undervaluation
the second thing i noticed is that these three businesses each
one of them had off the charts management off the charts owners and just
incredible capital allocation better than what i would find in a lot of developed
markets
the quality of the people was extremely high the competence of the
people was very high and the integrity of the people was very high
a rational
investor should weigh all of these factors in making a decision
i have a lot of
comfort in the investment we made
the funny thing is that in the last four
years the clouds over turkey have not lifted
there are still a lot of big clouds
over turkey
it did not stop reysas from going up 20 times in dollars
it still got
there somehow
i do not know how it got there but somehow it got there
that
is kind of how i see it
interviewer thanks very much mohnish
i can see from your background and for listeners
who cannot see it you have got a wonderful library behind you
the signature
question that we ask all our guests is whether you have a book
recommendation
i have high hopes for your book recommendation
mohnish the book i read this year that i enjoyed a lot is called what i learned about
investing from darwin
it was written by pulak prasad from singapore
it is an
exceptionally well written book
he is an exceptional investor
i read it twice
because i enjoyed it so much and i felt like maybe i missed a few things
pulak
has got a good sense of humor so it is a page turner it will keep you occupied
i made some changes to the way i invest after reading the book
there were a
lot of take home values so i recommend that
interviewer what sort of changes did you make to your process after reading that book
mohnish one of the things that pulak brought up is that in the investments he makes
one of his rules is that the companies cannot have any leverage
his perspective
on leverage needs to be zero
it is an extreme view
his logic for that is that he
feels that all companies are going to face tough times
times are good and
times are bad
that is the nature of business
when times are bad and the
business has no leverage it can play offense
whereas a highly levered
company when times get tough which i saw with my dad you are just trying
to survive and you are trying to keep the wolves at bay
if you are looking at
companies that you want to be around for a long time to finish first you must
first finish then reducing leverage or eliminating leverage is going to give you
a lot of levers that you can pull
now i have not gone a hundred percent down
the pulak path and of course the portfolio takes time to change but it is a very
important consideration
much more important than it was before where in
the past i would say okay the market cap is 5 billion and they have got 400 or
500 million debts
that is fine
just move on
i would not ask myself the
question can this business be run without debt
can they just eliminate
dividends for a couple of years and why is that debt out
why aren t they doing
that
how do they think about it
if you look at companies like berkshire
hathaway and the great businesses around they have built themselves around
that
if you lever up a business you are going to juice the returns but you also
take away the resilience
this is just one of the points he makes
he has many
other points
another interesting point which i also adopted is he does not
project
he has no projections for the future of what the earnings or cash flows
of any of his portfolio companies are going to be
that might sound like
blasphemy how can you run a portfolio without peering into the future
he
answers that it is an exercise in futility because we are making assumptions
if
each assumption is off by 20 what you have in the end is garbage
you have
four or five assumptions and each one is off by some small number which is
going to create a big error rate
pulak s approach is to buy and hold forever
he
views any sell decision as a mistake
if you go on his website they have listed
the entire portfolio
they run a hedge fund but it is closed
they do not take
new money but they have listed the entire portfolio including every exit
the
whole thing is public
their perspective is that when we are going to go into
business and invest in a business the holding period is forever
if the holding
period is forever why are we messing around with dcfs and all that
it is
irrelevant
