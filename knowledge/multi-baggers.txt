investing business is that unlike many other endeavors like if you play basketball or cricket or something else is that you can keep getting better at this throughout your life so it is kind of a an endeavor where continuous improvement and learning possible and actually desirable which is which is wonderful so what i wanted to actually kind of talk to you about today is that when we look at this large tent called value investing it encapsulates quite a range of approaches and focuses one could have while trying to create wealth and generate good returns and so on so for example buying a dollar that is trading for 50 cents would be a great way to be a value investor focusing on spin offs which george greenblatt wrote about is another way focusing on cannibals which is companies that are buying back their stock you know looking at what i call spawners which is businesses that are really good at creating new businesses and then you know spinning those off so that is that is another way one can go focusing on multi baggers is also well within the within the tent of value investing you know one could do special situation investing merger arbitrage it is a long list of endeavors and initiatives you know ben graham suggested net net investing and so on so there is many different approaches one can take which would all be within the tend to value investing you know they say that you re old too soon and why is too late and i ve you know made investments over the last quarter century or more which have covered pretty much almost all of these different ways of looking at things you know we also have things like p or ones you know things trading at low multiples of future video ones and that sort of thing as well what i ve been able to glean when i look at all of these different initiatives or different approaches that one can take is that across the globe there are maybe 50 000 or 100 000 stocks in different markets around the world and if one were to say that i only want to invest in companies that are trading at one or two times earnings one can find those one you know cast the net wide and deep one said i only want to buy 50 cent dollars or 30 cent dollars or 20 cent dollars you would find those as well so pretty much i think because the universe of prospective businesses is so wide and so large pretty much any criteria you set could work i think the important thing is that one is very focused in what one is looking for and has clarity of what one is looking for i ve come to the conclusion and it is actually a pretty you know it took me a long time to figure this out but i think for most of you it would would seem obvious is if there is such a thing as a best approach out of all of these approaches the best approach i think would be one where one focuses on multibaggers you know businesses that can be a 10x in 10 years or less or maybe 100x in 20 years if one focused purely on the multibands there are some advantages that come up with that approach one advantage is that one doesn t have much in terms of taxes because you ll be holding businesses for a long time under most jurisdictions around the world until the positions are sold unrealized gains are not taxed so basically it gives you an advantage and depending on the place on the planet that you practice this you know sometimes the tax rates can be as high as you know 40 50 deferring that for decades or let s say 10 years or more is a huge advantage because you get a free interest free loan from the government so so there is an advantage in terms of taxes with this approach the second advantage is that you do not have this continuous treadmill of needing to you know find something undervalued then it gets you know fairly valued and then you sell it and then you go look for something else so the multibagger of the multi bagger approach to investing has a few quirks and it requires us to kind of change our mindset on a few fronts so one of the one of the changes one has to make is that you know traditionally traditionally when one looks at what ben graham kind of you know father of value investing taught us is that you buy something for well below what it is worth and then as it approaches fair value you sell the position and then you you know go look for something else but in a in the multibagger framework what you would do is you would actually not particularly care if a position became fully valued or even overvalued so for example if you bought you know a business for 30 40 cents on the dollar and it is growing that dollar is growing and at some point it is worth 1 50 for example it is gone up more than 50 or what it used to be worth but the stock is trading at two dollars for example so under traditional gramian approaches you would sell that as you get past the dollar fifty or whatever but in in the quest for multi baggers you would continue to keep it in your portfolio even when it became overvalued you would you would sell it if it became egregiously overvalued so one would need to distinguish between something that is overvalued and something that is egregiously overvalued let s look at some examples of businesses that and you know that might help explain kind of where this approach is coming from and how it might work and so on so if we look at our business let s say mcdonald s for example you know mcdonald s was was formed in the i mean it i mean the business existed but ray kroc took it over in the 1950s i think they went public in the 1960s it is been public for maybe almost 60 years since then it is still growing you know the number of restaurants revenues profits etc i mean it is gone through some ups and downs over the years but it is it is it is grown and it is grown spectacularly and and i think from the time it went public till now it is north of a 10 000 bagger you know every dollar you invested is worth more than ten thousand dollars not a not a ten bag or a hundred bagger like a ten thousand plus bagger and why did mcdonald s do so well it did well because in the early days when when it got going there were a number of initiatives a number of innovations that mcdonald s had come up with some of you might have seen the movie the founder i think the founders i think it is on netflix i m not sure if it is on netflix in india but you might want to you know i think it is a very good movie to see there is also a biography that got written on mcdonald s called grinding it out it is also a good book it is a very old book but it is a great book to read there is another there is another book which was written by the the first ceo of burger king it is called the burger king and that is actually an amazing book as well but basically one of the early innovations mcdonald s came up with was that everything they sold could be eaten without a fork or a spoon or a knife there was no cutlery needed to you know french fries you could just take it from your hand and so on the other thing the other big innovation was that it was served really fast you know the the production time and actually if you really study mcdonald s internal processes and how it functions it is kind of like a light manufacturing type operation the software and engines they use internally is like what you would use in a light manufacturing operation and of course like for example they were very specific about the way the french fries should be with the russell potatoes so in fact like for example when mcdonald s enters a new country like india or russia etc it takes them two or three years from the time they decide to enter to the time they can open their first restaurant because it takes a couple of years to train the farmers and generate the supply chain for the right kind of potatoes and such so it takes takes them sometimes more than a couple of years just to open the restaurants and such but the interesting thing about something like mcdonald s is that almost all the innovations they came up with there were a lot of copycats and there were many businesses that came up that cloned or tried to clone what they were doing and in general fast food became a huge industry with many players it wasn t just burgers you know we then got a big kind of growth in pizzas chicken kfc so you know a lot of different entrants came in and also i think the on the consumer side it also changed in terms of what the frequency people were looking to eat all of this stuff but anyway even with all of that competition mcdonald s was able to establish a brand people knew before they went into a restaurant any mcdonald s what to expect the kind of standardization and you know consistency the cleanliness the consistency and and the nature of the service worked so that particular moat has been going strong for 60 years there aren t really any signs that say that the moat is eroding and may not do so well in the future they couldn t do well and it is a high it is a very high return on equity business so basically if you think about a franchised mcdonald s where you know an entrepreneur you know you know does a contract with the mcdonald corporation so in a franchise situation in the united states at least a lot of the real estate is owned by the mcdonald s corporation and the rent the rent that is charged to the franchisee is a percentage of sales like maybe around four percent of sales is the rent so if you think about the rent that mcdonald s charges its franchisees it is kind of automatically inflation indexed you know just goes up with inflation they also charge a franchise fee you know for the right to use the brand etc that might be another four percent or so and then the franchisees also buy a lot of the products they need from mcdonald s and usually on mcdonald s and a lot of the other franchise type operations will do is they tend not to focus on making money on the products they tend to focus on you know passing that through but you have the two main engines of the franchise fees and the rent which might be something like seven eight percent off the top line so if you look at it from the mcdonald corporation s point of view a typical mcdonald s in the u s might have something like two or three million in annual sales and the mcdonald s corporation might get something like you know 150 200 000 a year from that from that location the capital they have to put up against that is almost non existent because it is the entrepreneur who s you know paying for all the capex and the maintenance capex and all of that so it is a very capital light business so the the three legs that we need you know i think chuck akery called it the three legged stool the three legs that we need for these long multibaggers is first of all the core economics of the business should have very high returns on invested capital ideally without the use of use of debt right so you basically make like mcdonald s doesn t need to borrow money to make a lot of money the second is that we want very high integrity management and we want insider ownership you know kind of alignment of interest where there is a smart entrepreneur or someone or insiders who own it so they ve got incentives and the third is that we want a very long runway so where we can see that this thing can go on for a very long time and i think that when we you know if you were to pick up the annual report of let s say walmart for example walmart went public i think in 1972 or something it is like been public for like 50 years if you picked up the annual report of walmart let s say in 1980 for example a few years seven eight years after they went public you would see that they ve got very superior economics at the store level that they generate high returns on equity it is it is a business that does well very very rapid turnover inventory and so on and you would also see that it was embryonic in the sense that large portions of the united states at that time 1980 still did not have a walmart for most people you could not get to a walmart within you know 10 15 kilometers of your home so you could see that basically this business could actually if we just looked at it in north america there was a lot of room to grow and what we ve seen with mcdonald s is that it our walmart is that it wasn t just a u s story you know it was a global store so walmart has you know opened up in other countries and done well and you know we could look at other other businesses like let s say the coca cola company you know the cocoa company was formed about a hundred and years ago and that moat is still growing after 130 years and again the unit economics are extremely attractive because the coca cola company typically doesn t do bottling they sell the syrup so they have you know these plants which sell they do not even sell the syrup they sell syrup concentrate so basically it is almost like a software business where you know if you re if you re spending five or ten rupees on a on a coke coca cola company might get like eight percent of that and they do not have very little cost against that so again it is it is very similar to mcdonald s in terms of in terms of economics so basically there are there are businesses different kinds of businesses you can look at a business like mastercard or visa or american express and they have similar attributes where you have very high returns on invested capital you have a very long runway and you have high integrity management inside ownership and so on so if one pursues these now you know the nature of capitalism is that everyone wants to own these kinds of businesses once these kind of moats and you know runways etc are well known the businesses get priced to perfection and they may not be available at a cheap price and so for example if we look at a business in india like dmart for example and dmart you know similar model to costco and aldi outside india and dmard is very embryonic today there is very few dmarch stores in india relative to what could possibly be their penetrations in 10 20 or 30 years but the market recognizes that and so dmr trades at you know huge multiples it doesn t appear optically cheap but the interesting thing is that if the runways are really long and they actually end up being runways that go on for you know several decades then even an expensive looking price can end up being a great value investment but but i think that as as value investors you know we have to also have a good dose of skepticism in in how we approach these things so we can not always assume that you know everything s going to go to the moon in terms of terms of size and growth and the nature of capitalism is that there will be a lot of competition that will try to go up against those modes but but i think that i think that if you know there is a there is a quote from the upanishads which goes something like this as is your wish so is your will as is your will so is your deed and as is your deed so is your destiny and then kind of the punchline is your deepest desire is your destiny so going back you know to what i started with you know if you said i want to focus on 50 cent dollar bills and that is your deepest desire you will find those if it is if you say i want 20 cent dollar bills you will find those two if you say that i only want to invest in businesses that can go up 100 times in value in 10 20 30 years you can find those too so it is a matter of what you choose to focus on and as long as you re willing to put in the work to sift through company after company you know with the framework that you re interested in so in in the case of the multibagger framework there are just three things that matter and then the fourth is the price obviously so if a business doesn t generate high returns of equity you re done you do not need to spend any time on that if the business needs a lot of debt to grow and generate higher returns and equity you would also be done you do not even need those if management quality or ethics is a question you re also done you do not need those either and so just just if you look at the businesses that generate high returns and equity that alone would wipe out large swaths of businesses and then you know you get to the runway right so dmart will be a lot larger in 10 or 15 15 years than it is today i think that is a pretty easy bet to make that the statistically i think the odds are high that something like dmart might do well we could make that statement about private sector banks in india you know private sector banks in india might be like a third of the banking pie in india today and maybe in 10 or 20 years it might be half or two thirds of the pie for example and the pie itself would have grown so there are there are things that we could hang our hat on and then kind of take it from there so basically i think that if you if you go down this path which is the multibagger path the interesting thing is that and and all all value investing there are a couple of data points you know john templeton used to say that the very best value investor or analyst will be wrong one out of three times like 33 error rate is the lowest error rate for the very best practitioner of the art if you were a kind of brain surgeon and you had even a three percent error rate there might not be too many people coming to you for brain surgery but i think in terms of value investing you could be wrong half the time and i think i ve probably been wrong close to half the time and still end up with a phenomenal track record so and especially if you focus on the multibaggers you know companies that would go up 10x or 100x basically in a lifetime of investing if you end up ended up finding just two or three or four hundred baggers at the age that you re at right now that is all you need in many cases if you just found one that might be all you need and so we have all this time and on the other end we just need to find things just once do not even need to find them that many times when i started investing started my journey value investing about 27 years ago 94 95
in the first in the first five years when i was not running my funds i was just running my own money i started with about one million dollars in 95
by the time in the first five years i had had 200 baggers in the first five years itself and then i think from 2000 to 2022 now i haven t had any 100 but i think that there might be some more in the future some that are kind of you know still hopefully going through their their journey so so you do not need you do not need very many of them a few of them can get you to the promised land and i ve had i would say i ve had when i look back a rather sloppy journey as an investor because i was trying all these different things if i think if in 94 or 95 had done what i am telling you to do now or suggesting what you should do now i think i would have done a lot better than how i ve done so if i had purely focused 10 or 100 baggers i think i think the results would be vastly better i remember in 95 january 95 when i had the one million dollars i d mostly invested in the u s markets but i had a interest in the indian markets as well and i thought there were two or three areas where it could do well and i decided to put 20 000 out of the one million dollars just just two percent of the portfolio into india at that time and i opened a brokerage account and so just my own monies opened nre brokerage account with kotak i decided to put half that money ten thousand dollars in one stock which was a it company and i was in the i was in the i t services business at the time so i know i knew this business really well satyam computers which at that time actually was a pretty honest company they kind of went wayward i think in terms of their ethics about 10 12 years after that but in 95 they were a clean company so i put 10 000 to satyam and in 95 and i think by the time it was 2000 it had gone up 150x the 10 000 would become one and a half million dollars approximately 1 4 million or something and then the remaining 10 000 i put into three other stocks i bought two of the courier companies that were listed in india at the time blue dart and skypac courier because my perspective was that the indian postal service was just host and if you really wanted to get a package from point a to point b in india you really had to rely on private people to get it for you i do not think the postal service was reliable and so i thought that these businesses that were focused on that would do quite well so i was just going to make three investments actually half and satyam and then half in these other two and then at the last minute i was also very impressed with kotak because i was just very impressed in dealing with their people and so i decided to split the other ten thousand three ways you know one about thirty two thirty three hundred in kotak and thirty three hundred to the other two businesses so when this 10 000 became 1 4 million or whatever in 2000 the other three businesses had done nothing for five years it was pretty much sitting close to what i had paid for them like no movement for the most part it is not realistic to think that if you put 20 000 in the indian market and you get you know 1 4 million something like a 70x that you there is still some meat on that bone and there is stint some juice to be extracted if you will so i said this is a pretty good result and for no really good reason in 2000 i sold the other three stocks and i told kotak you know sell these stocks and just send me the money back i basically liquidated the entire indian portfolio in 2000
there was no there was no really good reason to sell blue dart or skype or kota no particular reason that i had to do that kotak from 2000 till now is about a 500x blue dot is about a 300 x sky pack went kind of backwards i think eventually went bankrupt but it was down like 90 or something so basically there were massive home runs there were two massive home runs which like i said i there was no reason to kind of make that decision to sell but that is what happened and you know i missed those two rides but even with these sloppy nature and kind of stupid analysis that i did in those cell decisions the end result was fine and the remaining 980 000 that had invested in the us over the next four five years by 99 2000 it was about 13 million or so so that had gone up quite a bit because one of those one of those bets had gone up 100 x 100 000 became about 10 million or so so anyway the thing is that even with a lot of sloppiness what i m saying is that basically what what when you look at that investing that took place then just the two bets that were 100 bagger were responsible for like 80 90 of the returns it didn t matter the rest didn t matter if it all went to zero the results were still been great and so that is the nature of this multi bagger type investing is that it can tolerate a very high error rate and of course your your objective as an analyst should be to try to keep the error rate as low as possible in 2019 i was visiting istanbul for the second time and turkish market actually i think is the cheapest market in the world because they ve got just a lot of crazy macro things going on in the country very high inflation and weird policies and everyone s exited and so on in fact turkey reminds me of the indian markets maybe in the early 90s or so on and i ran into this business on my second trip in 2019 where the market cap was 20 million dollars and the liquidation value was more than six or seven hundred million dollars it was actually a dollar bill trading for three cents which i do not think it never happened to me before then so in the previous 24 years of investing that never happened and i think till i leave planet hurt i do not think it will happen again but basically you know if i look at this business which i bought at you know three cents on the dollar like the 20 million market cap i i was surprised with the volumes obry funds owns one third of that business and we pretty much got one third of the business for like eight million dollars or something if the business did not increase in value at all but it got to fair value at some point we would have a 30x return 30 or 33x or something but now we want the business for what three years they ve actually increased value of the business quite a bit in the last three years and it is run by phenomenal people really good capital allocators and i think they will increase the value of the business quite significantly in the years ahead so having learned my lesson from kotak and blue dart and so on the only thing i need to do with this business is do nothing just sit there and spend time talking to students like you so that the time is used up and not used to sell things hopefully 20 years from now we still own that business so if that business tripled in what it is worth the value like you know was 600 billion million or something let s say it became 2 billion we would have 100 and i think it can it can triple its value in maybe five or ten years and it can keep going after that i mean the the two people running it they re not that old so i think they could they could keep compounding for a while and so when i look at kind of that particular business and it is it is a small part of the portfolio today it is gone up i think in the last three years it is gone up like five six x or so so it is gradually moving towards its its value and so on but i m just saying that the nature of these hundred daggers is that this one business could become bigger than everything else in the portfolio even though we made such a small bet with it so with that i think i ll stop there would love to hear what you have on your mind we can talk about what i just talked about or stuff that isn t related so thank you thank you sir for the insightful session it was so interesting to listen listen to you now we will open the flow for questions from the audience those who want to ask that question can raise their hand okay sonia you may go first okay thank you for this insightful session so in this today we always listen a lot that the value of anything is added in the modern world so what is your opinion on this well you know all intelligent investing is value investing because we have so many stocks around the world and because there are so many things going on with different companies around the world that you know like this news anchor jim cramer says there is a bull always a bull market somewhere so i think that if one is a investment analyst and you know picks through stuff you will you will find that there are some parts of the markets and some parts of the of the ecosystem that is appears very overvalued but you ll also find that there is lots of things that are hated and unloved and like for example you know turkey is hated and unloved so there are always in in it is in the nature of auction driven markets that they will overshoot and undershoot i mean one one simple data point you can look at is look at the price of any stock on the nsc or bse and look at the 52 week range on that stock you know it might be 50 to 150 or 100 to 200 or 500 to 1000
it is a like a 50 100 swing in one year for almost every stock like all 5000 stocks right but if you look at for example the cost of an apartment in mumbai for example you know apartment in bandra or some place and you have a friend who s a broker or an agent and you go to him every day and say what is my flat word he ll say your flat is worth three crores and then you go to him the next day and say what is my flat work now he ll say it is still three crores and then you go to him after one week and you ask him again what is my flat word he ll say listen idiot it is still three crores and you keep bothering this guy every day and then maybe after three months he might say you know it is actually 3 1 crores you know it has moved a little bit 3 1 crore now i can get you 3 1 crores and then maybe in six months or eight months if you keep bothering him and he s still your friend every day maybe it becomes three point three crores you know in a year or something okay possible maybe three and a half or might go to two and a half you know the fluctuation rate of that flat is not going to range between three and six crores in a year it is going to be like 2 7 to 3 3 crore in a very tight band because that price is not being set in an auction format it is being set with an intelligent buyer facing an intelligent seller and when you have intelligent buyers facing intelligence sellers you get great practice price discovery but when you have these you know auction driven markets which is the nsc or bse or new york stock exchange you will get much wider swings and so if you re in a in in the business of investing where you are dealing with auction driven markets just this phenomena of the 50 swing means at some point the stock is mispriced it has to be at one it has to be either under price at some point overpriced at some point because the real value of the business cannot change 50 in a year for most businesses so hence we have proved that there is always value in investments and markets thank you sir okay we you can ask a question thanks for the like my question is essentially around specifically to india we have a lot of corporate governance issues within india so when you are picking companies how are you filtering out these companies which have significant corporate governance issues which an hour later for example that had massive issues later on so what kind of filters do you use when you are investing or picking i think that your filters need to be stronger investing in india than i would have in the us i think that if i were to invest only in the new york stock exchange type businesses the odds that i would lose money because of fraud approaches zero you know i would say if i make 10 investments all in the new york exchange and i have a lifetime of investing i do just in that market maybe out of you know 50 investments i make in a 40 50 year period at the most one might be fraudulent something like that it would be pretty low number in india if i did the same thing i think the number would be higher but i think the that given that we already know that that the ethos levels of let s say managers or managements in india may be somewhat lower than the ethos level of a typical nyc comp listed company we can adjust for that so there are plenty of businesses in india where one can reach a fairly decent conclusion that the ethics and ethos of the business and the owners is high and there may be a lot of businesses where we may not be able to make that determination so if we either know that ethics is low or governance has issues or we re not able to figure it out you just take a pass on those businesses just like you would take a pass on a low return equity business you know it could be very ethical but return equity is low because there is 5 000 listed companies you still end up in a decent universe to look at so i think i think if you if you set up rigorous filters for ethics it may not be foolproof but you can reduce the error rate okay but you can ask your question thank you for your great session myself my question is that how what is your strategy in identifying and valuing a company and how do you identify your first talk is overvalued or undervalued i think that if a business is within your circle of competence i mean let s let s take the example of a business like dmart for example and let s say i have not looked at dmart recently but let s say for example a trailing pe basis is trading at 100 times earnings which you know it used to trade it or maybe still trading it something like that if one understood the business and one had a good view of what the cash flows of the business are over the next 10 or 20 years you can discount those cash flows back and then that would tell you whether the business is overvalued or undervalued it would just be a straight math exercise so and if you are not able to estimate those cash flows then i think there is no basis on which you could make an investment like that so you would take a pass in that particular case the first question to ask yourself is do i understand the business and is the business within my circle of competence and if you understand the business and the business is within your circle of competence then by definition you know with some boundaries what the future of the business is likely to look like and what the trajectory is like to look at what the cash flows are like likely to look like and i think if you can put some boundaries around that then you have a basis to make an investment in in 2015 an indian guy living in vancouver canada his name is parry pasricha he had sent me i didn t know him he sent me a write up of a company based in hyderabad called rain industries and basically at that time you know the extremely well written write up like 20 page pdf it is actually i think that write up is floating on the internet so i think if you if you just google like very persuasion industry probably that pdf will pull up there is another guy luca franca who had done a report on reign and i think that is also in the internet somewhere that was done before perry did his report but basically the situation that perry was bringing up in that report was that rain was trading at i think 35 rupees a share at that time about a you know 170 or 180 million market cap at that time with about two billion dollars in revenue it was trading at about one tenth of sales the price to sales ratio was 0 1 it seemed very likely that in the next four or five years in a single year rain s earnings would be over 35 rupees a share so when i looked at rain it is a very cyclical business it has a lot of gyrations a lot of issues with it but it was extremely cheap in effect it was trading at a future peo one i couldn t find anything wrong with it so i made i made a bet on rain industries and as a foreign investor we could only buy 9 99 and so we bought 9 99 percent of the business for i think 20 million dollars by less than three years after we bought in early 2018 late 2017 it was trading at over 400 rupees a share so my my thesis when i originally invested was that i think i thought i just want to own this business when the earnings are 35 rupees and i just want to see what the market would do with the price of the stock when the earnings are 35 rupees a share i just want to see if it actually sits at 35 rupees at that point and which i didn t think was possible but i just wanted to see what happened so this was just a pure math game and of course when the earnings i think their earnings were coming to close to 10 rupees a quarter when they were approaching 9 or 10 rupees a quarter the stock went to like 440 rupees and of course by that time i had fallen madly in love with rain and it is great management and they re very high ethics and very very honest competent operators i said no this is a this is a far better business than i thought it is and you know we shouldn t get off the bus so quickly you know all most of the time i probably didn t get off the bus too quickly so rain went from 35 rupees in 2015 to 440 rupees in early 2018 to 60 rupees in march of 2020 when covet hit to about 160 or 170 rupees currently okay and we still own it right but even if you take the current situation you know with a 160 or something in in rupees it is like a 4x in seven years for example and you know we think it ll do better and be worth more in the future so i think in that case you know like i said it is it is like we i couldn t i do not i still do not have a crystal ball on reign of what next 10 years of cash flows would be that is i think impossible to estimate but i think the fact that we would make money on that investment was a very high probability certain in public auction markets my question digresses a bit it is for the private markets venture capital in particular i want to understand what parameters will you employ for investing in early stage startups from a value investing lens in the context of a where price discovery as you mentioned is ambiguous b given the current news of funding winter and the capital drying up yeah i mean i think that i m probably not the right person to ask that question to i think the the closer you go towards the formation date of a business and then try to extrapolate the future of that business the more murky it becomes so the the venture capital game is a very different game in the sense that you are expecting most of your returns to come from one or two bets in the fund for example and you re expecting 80 90 of the fund may a lot of those investments may go by the wayside or may not do much long term so basically it is a very different game i think it is very hard to get downside protection in the venture game and i think it is very hard to do these future cash flow projections and all of that because we just do not have the trademarks we do not have the the historical trend mark so it is it is not something that i think i have expertise and the other thing about the venture business is that if we look at the statistics you know so in in silicon valley which has had a very long history of venture capital the venture funds that have let s say the top 10 percent you know their annualized returns and the top 10 percent of venture funds their returns are multiples of so you know the top quartile funds have done much much better than the bottom quartile funds and if you do the same thing with bond funds for example the difference between a top quartile bond fund and a bottom quartile bond fund may be almost non existent might be like 100 basis points or 200 basis points would be a very very small difference so what i m saying is that the ability to add alpha in a bond fund is very limited and if we if we look at a if we look at a fund like you know sequoyah fund or andreessen aurovitz or y combinator etc they have an advantage they have multiple advantages but one of the big advantages they have is deal flow so i have some friends and you know some of my investors are venture capitalists in silicon valley they say to me that if we had access to the trash can of sequoia our returns would be 3x what they are so if he said if we could just look at every deal that sequoia turned down we would do 3x better because they said we just do not get to see you know so deal flow so one of the one of the things about the public markets is the small investor actually has a huge advantage over the institutional investor an institutional investor with you know hundreds of millions or billions of dollars cannot look at small investments they just they have to put large amounts of money to work at a time a small investor having you know five crores to invest or 50 lakhs to invest 10 lakhs to invest can look at everything you can look at nano caps can look at everything and so their universe is much wider and they can be a lot more picky in terms of where they put their money so in the public markets the small investor has a huge advantage in the venture market a small investor or an unknown investor with no no access to real deal flow is at a huge disadvantage so my conclusion when i look at all of that is it is not a game where the odds are in my favor and so i have chosen not to play in that area and i think the kinds of questions you re asking i think are very difficult questions to answer thank you in the interest of time we will take only last two questions beyonce you may go you may go you can go first i do not know if the others can hear you or not but i can barely hear you but okay go ahead will try i put my question in the chat box if that will happen yeah i think i think for a know nothing investor passive index investing is a great way to go especially if you have you know many decades of time and you re young and so on i think index investing does well the frictional costs are low and such if you have a view and you understand certain businesses you understand they re undervalued and and so on then i think you could actually you know pick stocks and so on but i would say starting baseline being a passive investor is certainly a great way to go for most people next sure thank you thank you sir for an insightful session so my question is very simple so when we look at value investing which was being propagated by say the likes of ben graham we did not have the modern situation right and a of a negative usual reach for a longer period of time but then liquidity both absolute and relative so do you think that probably sticking to that value investing may result in risking probably figuring out who the future winners could be or simply put probably what would you change in value investing which has been taught or which has been learned to something which would be more relevant in a current context yeah i think it is a good question so i think that most investors would be better off completely ignored everything macro so for example if if i had a viewpoint of kind of what would happen to starbucks 20 years ago it really doesn t matter what the rates are and the fed is doing and what you know what financial crisis is happening or whatever else has happened at the core the starbucks business is such that when they open a store in the u s they get their money back in two years 35 return on capital they do not franchise any stores and when they open a store in china they get their money back in 15 months like something like 70 return on capital and i mean they have found for example that if they have one store in manhattan in a particular intersection and they put another store diagonal from that store it doesn t even cannibalize the first store when the second store is so close and such so it is an it is an incredible business so i think that if one focuses on understanding the business and is able to identify great businesses that should be where the focus is when i made the investment in turkey in this in this business it was completely irrelevant to me what was happening on the macro front i mean turkey inflation rates are crazy and the way they deal with the currency is crazy but i was i could look at that business and see that these things would not really matter in terms of our returns and basically when i made the investment in that business one dollar was five lira you know five leader could get you one dollar now it is almost 18 lira to get one dollar so i have suffered incredible devaluation but in dollar terms we are up for x in lira terms we are up infinite x but who cares about that so what i m saying is that we had extreme headwinds macro headwinds when we went in didn t care about it and it didn t matter so i think it is it is very important to be right on the business if you were early on mcdonald s and walmart or any of these you know mastercard visa whatever coke and so on i think the thing is that you know some of these you know long runways they will transcend everything that is the key is can you find these great businesses can you find them early enough can you buy them at decent prices and then can you be patient through thick and thin sure that is that is why there is a there is a investment bank in nariman point enam most of you will be familiar with imam you know they took infosys public and when they took infosys public they were having difficulty placing the stock you know they were the underwriter they were left with stock that nobody was willing to buy enam kept the stock for themselves until pretty recently they kept most of those shares i think they may have they may have reduced or eliminated the position now or it is a small much smaller position but basically it doesn t matter what else inarm did in the last 30 years it is irrelevant what they did in the last 30 years 90 percent of the value of that firm was based on whether or not they kept that infosys stock that nobody wanted and so it is a good business they re great people and they re smart people but one decision you know trumps all the other decisions and if they had sold infosys or they had found a lot of people willing to buy it i think inam would be a shadow of itself where it is today so you know it is just small small things like that create huge deltas in where things end up thank you thank you so much sir sir can we take up one last question by pawn if time permits you of course yes but when you can ask your question thank you so much sir and thanks a lot for your wisdom sir today so my question is regarding multibaggers as we discussed so during our holding period of say 10 15 20 odd years we see drawdowns of over north of like 50 percent sometimes even 90 percent during the 10 year investment 10 years so how do you deal with that situation and it often arises when you are holding for such a long period of time especially for multivitamins yeah so conviction is really important and how do you get conviction i mean i think i think you get conviction because you have a very strong understanding of the business so if i if i go back to the business in turkey for example basically you know that business has a number of different business lines but the one that has the most value today is they have 12 million square feet of prime warehouse space in turkey it is mostly in istanbul and that 12 million square feet has a value today you know you could go to a broker he will tell you that you can sell the whole thing and you will probably get a billion dollars for it something like that billion billion two or something there is only about 100 million 80 million of debt so if you just liquidate that entire position you ll get about maybe 900 million dollars or something and you know so what is the warehouse so warehouse is land concrete steel some 20 is refrigerated so you have some refrigerated units and all that all of these things are going to increase in value if you have inflation so steel price is going to go up because it is going to it is going to track international steel prices concrete and cement prices will track international concrete and ceramic prices and land also has prime land and a prime you know major city in the world has a value and so when i invested the value per square foot was about eighty dollars a square foot for land and improvements and i do not think that 80 is going anywhere you know it it may be 200 a square foot at some point but it will not go to 30 square foot that will not happen so so i do not care about anything else that is going on that is the piece that is the most important it is 99 lease it is 10 years inflation index leases and all of that so conviction is really important right so if you if you invested in starbucks you would have two or three things that you understand you would understand the unit economics that when they open a store they get their money back in one or two years you would understand that if that suddenly changed where it was taking five years or ten years to get your money back when you open a new store something has changed right that is a significant change if that looks like a secular permanent change the thesis has changed but if you if it continues to be very high returns on capital the second is you would have had some perspective on the runway where you say okay it has 5000 stores around the world for example it probably has more than that right now but at 20 years from now i think it can easily be 25 000 stores for example and if you have conviction on that then you know you the two pieces that really matter is that what are the unit economics and what is the store count you know and those are really the pieces that matter and so when you make an investment in a stock you should be able to explain the thesis of that investor investment in five or ten sentences to a ten year old without a spreadsheet and without anything okay and this is why this makes sense and that gives you the conviction if you have to go look at a spreadsheet or look at something to then you know when price drop 50 to understand what is going on you have not done your homework so it needs to get down when you ve done all the work to simplicity you know it can take a long time to get to those essence of these businesses but it needs to get to the essence of those businesses so you have to get to understanding why is this business resilient why will it be around 10 years from now and why will the economics and the return on equity and all of that still be high why will all those things be true so we aren t particularly concerned with price movements we are concerned with the expansion or shrinkage of the moon if the mote goes through a secular decline we have a problem the quoted price changing is not relevant sir thank you so much thank you so much sir for your insights before we conclude this amazing session sbm nmims would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to mr monis fabry for sparing his valuable time to grace this event and enlighten us with some really practical practical and usable words of wisdom we would also like to extend our gratitude to all the attendees for their unabated attention to our event and for some really good questions we definitely have something to take back home what was more intriguing for us was how you identify stocks whether it is through chalk acres three legged stool which can become multibagger for example mcdonald s coca cola etc and i m very sure if we replicate this approach we can make money for ourselves if knowledge is power then curiosity is the muscle
all right
anyway it is a pleasure and a honour to be invited back to be with
you
i have always find the students at peking university as the best of any
students i interact with anywhere in the world
it is an amazing group of
people
i am honoured and humbled to be with this august audience and i
am also very excited to continue the interaction and dialogue
i think this is
the fourth time we have had different venues and including once in irvine
and once in beijing and a couple of times now online
anyway what i
wanted to do was that i wanted to share a few slides and thoughts with you
and then we can open up to questions and we can talk about what i have
just presented or we can talk about whatever you would like to speak on
the thing is that when i look back at my life and journey as a value investor
there are two years that stand out in terms of being a very significant step
function in terms of the learning and growth i went through
the first time
that happened was in 1994 which is about 26 years ago
when i heard about
warren buffett for the first time and i had never been in the investing
business or never even really i might have bought a stock here and there
but really didn t understand investing
i was taken and surprised by buffett s
approach to investing to the point that in the next few years i shifted
completely to becoming an investor
i am an engineer by training and i was
running an it services company
in a few years i made the switch
completely to a full time investor
1994 was a year of tremendous learning
and growth for me and it was really helpful
then the second time i went
through a step function of growth was this year in 2020
for most people
year 2020 they like to forget and move on because of the pandemic and all
the issues we have had with shutdowns and all the fatalities and health
issues and so on
maybe it was because of all the time at home
i am not
sure
but i found that i went through another renaissance this year and i
wish i had gone through this second renaissance many years ago
but i
think charlie munger says we are old too soon and why is too late but it s
better late than never
i want to talk about one aspect of the renaissance
that i went through and it is changing my approach to investing quite
significantly a lot of these things will appear very obvious to you
some of
us like me are not that smart it maybe not so obvious but let me share
these with you and then we can talk about it
if you are an investor a value
investor really at the highest level you have got kind of two kinds of options
in terms of the businesses you can invest in
you can invest in what i would
call growing pies these are businesses that have strong growth ahead of
them
they have got long runways and these businesses can get pretty
large
one can do quite well investing in growing pies even if one is paying
what might appear to be an optically expensive price and there are many
advantages to being an investor in growing pies
you can set it and forget it
this is really one of the only ways you can get to really strong multi bagger
returns maybe 10 times your money or a hundred times your money
growing pies is definitely a great way to go
the second way to invest is
discounted pies and discounted 50 cent dollars bills or 40 cent dollar bills
here you are on a treadmill of activity because you have to buy and sell
then again buy and again sell and keep doing that in taxable accounts
it
can be tax inefficient and it is difficult to get more than a double or triple
because if you bought a company at 50 off and it did not grow and you
were correct about it then maybe you will double your money when that
valuation gap closes
maybe even if it gets some growth you might get
three times your money or something but it is hard to get more than that
when i started as an investor in 94 having just heard about buffett and so
on i was focused on growing pies
the period from 94 to about 99 2000
was a period of very strong stock market returns in the us
it eventually kind
of peaked with a very massive bubble the dollar bubble of 2000
then of
course the nasdaq index crashed and burned
it dropped about 80 and
even the s p had a very long period of no returns
i could see by 98 99 that
things were getting frosty
i had done really well in that period
in fact i
captured 200 bagger in that period
i was an individual investor at the time
i was not running a fund but then i got concerned around late 99 that this
party at some point will end and it will probably end badly
the market was
really interesting at that time because there were a set of companies that
were very overvalued but there was another whole set of businesses that
were not sexy businesses which were very modestly priced and even
maybe severely under priced
one could actually make investments in
those businesses
for example in 2000 the day the nasdaq peaked i think
march 6th or march 9th 2000 was the same day that berkshire hathaway
hit a multi year low in stock price
i think the berkshire stock price at that
time got down to about 40 000
it was literally that people were pulling
money out of berkshire hathaway and putting it into pets com or
chemdex com all these different kinds of euphoric etoys and all these
things that were going on at the time
i switched in the early two thousand
from investing in growing pies to focusing on discounted pies because i
thought the index would give me a lot of headwinds and traditionally
growing pies were quite overheated and such
what i should have done
probably maybe a few years back maybe three or four years ago five years
ago was i should have switched back because we did extremely well with
discounted pies in the funds
because the nasdaq was flat from 2000 to
2016
it basically went nowhere
in fact it went down quite a bit before it
got back to the same 2000 level
the s p 500 was flat till about 2012
they
took a long time to get back to their previous highs
obviously the better
way to invest between these two is growing pies
but you also need to keep
in mind a little bit about where the market and the index is at where you
are not kind of getting to euphoric if you will
if you look at this path to 10
200 baggers there could be more but there are basically five ways you
could get there right
one is you could buy these what i would call focused
mouse straps
these are very narrowly focused players with long runways
like moutai in china which just opened its first store in china mcdonald s
and so on
you could also get there with great capital allocators kind of like
berkshire hathaway or danaher or exor which is based in europe
or you
could also get there by investing in uber cannibals
uber cannibals are
companies that are very focused on stock buybacks and they end up buying
back large portions
for example a company like nvr which is a us based
home builder since 1996 and started doing stock buybacks until now 2020
they bought back something like 82 of their shares outstanding
just 18
of the shares outstanding are left and nvr has delivered i think more than
70 baggers
in that period the stock has gone up more than 70 times
in fact
in the last 20 years it has gone up more than 55 times and the business
actually has not grown that much
all they have done is they have taken all
their free cash flow every year and pounded it into buybacks
autozone is
another one
these are not rapidly growing businesses
but again similar
story
then one that happened in the sixties and seventies was teledyne
with henry singleton
in fact there is a book that you might enjoy called
distant force
teledyne issued a lot of stock in the 1960s when it acquired
almost 150 businesses when the market gave it a very high multiple
then in
the 1970s when the us equity markets were very cheap and collapsed
teledyne was trading at maybe single digit multiple of earnings henry
singleton bought back more than 80 of the stock
again in the case of
teledyne they delivered about 125 times the value from 1960 to 1980 it was
about 125 x
then you can also get to multi baggers by buying deeply
undervalued players companies that have gone down a lot
i have done
some of that
these are some companies i have invested in
teck cominco
was one i bought during the financial crisis in 09 it became a 10 bagger
fiat chrysler in 2012 which also did very well
then great industries more
recently
but the one i want to talk about today which is part of the
renaissance this year is the spawners and the spawners are companies
that continuously spawned related and unrelated businesses
very few
companies have the dna to be great spawners
we will drill down a little bit
on the different kinds of spawners
basically these are companies that have
a deep conviction of and really it is part of the dna to keep adding and
incubating new businesses that have the potential to be massive growth
engines
they expect many of these things to fail and they take failure in
stride
a good example is the bezos quote
if they are staying in day one
requires you to experiment patiently accept failures plant seeds protect
saplings and double down when you see customer delight
amazon is one
of the great spawner companies that we have
spawning also has a lot of
advantages in fact a lot more advantages than cannibals because
cannibals have to pay tax on their earnings and then they can use the
money to buy back shares
in the case of spawning what you are doing is
you are basically reducing your net income which basically then reduces
your taxes
in effect you are getting an interest free loan from the
government on very easy terms payable when able
for example through
most of its history amazon has hardly reported much in earnings
their core
business was quite profitable but they were taking all the cash flows and
continuously investing them into new bets
30 40 of the money that they
were investing would have gone to the government if they didn t do that
it
is a very capital efficient way to do this if you are good at spawning
there
are different kinds of spawners and i came up with these different
spawners on my own they may be more but i think this captures a lot of it
adjacent spawners are companies that create businesses that are close to
the business they are already on in like amazon when they started they
were only selling books and then they started adding more categories
they
started selling music and they kept adding more categories
it didn t require
a lot of change in the business
that is what i would call adjacent spawners
embryonic spawners are companies that acquire businesses and then
nurture them into much larger enterprises
for example through most of its
history microsoft has not been an acquisitive company
it basically kind of
grew its businesses organically but they bought what we know as
powerpoint as they actually bought the company and then they changed
the name to powerpoint and then made it part of office
that was the
example of an embryonic spawner
cloner spawners are not innovative
they just copy successful products
microsoft is a good example of cloner
spawners and then non adjacent spawners creator or buying new unrelated
business areas
for example recently during the pandemic byd went into
the manufacturing of n95 masks
that business has nothing to do with what
one would consider the core competencies of byd but chuan fu wang has
never been limited by core competencies
he has repeatedly gone into
businesses
when you would look at him from the outside you would say
he has no competence in this but he has repeatedly shown that he can get
competent
they entered the car business and they were able to make that
quite a success which is difficult
they entered the n95 mass business and
i am pretty sure if they haven t already turned business they will
then apex
spawner is a business that uses all four of these strategies and such
generally speaking the reason i am giving you these categories is apex
spawners are very rare and apex spawners can be amongst the very best
investments you can make because they have got so many different ways
to nirvana
it s kind of a swiss army knife
they can bring out different tools
and they are really good at all of the above
let us look at some of these
spawners with some examples
adjacent spawns we can look at starbucks
they created the consumer packet good the frappuccino bottles which
first they did a deal with pepsi which they sold in supermarkets
they
created a coffee machine
i think now in china they have opened the
starbucks reserve stores which have done really well
they are also
experimenting with alcohol infused drinks and such which is quite a
significant departure from what is traditionally a starbucks store
but they
are doing all these spawns and it extends the runway
facebook has been
really good at embryonic spawning where they bought instagram and they
bought whatsapp
they bought oculus and they have taken these
embryonic businesses and they have created pretty significant value and
growth
the same with what google did with youtube
very significant grid
or what google did with android which is also a company they bought
microsoft doesn t do much embryonic spawning but like i told you they
bought a company named forethought and then later renamed it as
powerpoint
but they are very good at cloner spawning windows the mac
word and excel from word perfect and lotus explorer from netscape
surface from the ipod azure from google and amazon web services and
teams from slate and such apex spawners i told you they are very rare
if
you can spot a apex spawner early in its journey it can be very attractive
and can give you a pretty long runway
because what happens is amazon
started with just a bookstore it is like all eggs in one basket
but as they
start doing more things because these are mostly digital bets the return on
capital is extremely high
it can also tolerate all of failure
they have done a
very good job with obviously the adjacent spawning embryonic spawning
like they bought zappos and whole foods
cloner you know some of these
cloners didn t work
like they came up with a fire phone which they offered
for i think 99 cents
but they couldn t get any traction
then the fire phone
was buried and they moved on
then they have done non adjacent
spawning like amazon web services is quite a departure from their typical
retail and it is done very well
kindle was quite a departure because it
required quite a few different competencies
similarly alphabet has done
all of the above
they have done a lot of embryonic stuff
they have also
done a lot of non adjacent stuff where they have gone into things like
google fiber and so on
alibaba you guys are very familiar with alipay
which is the adjacent spawning
they have done a number of things on the
embryonic front cloners and then even the non adjacent with the alibaba
cloud and alitrip
berkshire hathaway the insurance was a spawn that ajit
jain did for them
probably worth over a hundred billion in value that that
business has created for berkshire from scratch where they pretty much
didn t have to put up a lot of risk capital to make that happen
for
embryonic they bought geico and it had been around for a long time but
it was pretty small less than 2 market share of the us insurance business
now it is more than 10
mid american energy has grown a lot
nebraska
furniture mart has grown a lot
they have started some digital insurance
companies recently three insurance and biberk these are cutting out the
agent
they have cloned some of the other players like i think wilco and so
on
then tencent again has done a number of things on all of the above
you guys use wechat the games future mobility and baidu is very similar
they have kind of done all of the above
these have been tremendous home
runs especially if you have got them early
one spawner i just want to talk
about is kotak mahindra a company in india
i actually was smart enough
to make a very small investment in this company in 1995 and i was also very
dumb where i sold the company in 2000 with almost no returns
i will come
back to this slide in a second but i just want to show you kind of what
happened with kotak
in 1995 i invested a small amount of money in india
maybe around 25 000
personally i was going to invest in three businesses
in india at the time which i thought they all had huge runways
kotak was
actually my broker that had opened the account in dealing with them
i was
just really impressed with the quality of the people i was dealing with
pretty
much at the last minute i said out of this 25 000 i will put 3000 or so into
kotak because they were listed company and such
what happened with
my 25 000 investment is one company that i would invest about 10 000 in
was 140 x
it became 1 4 million in about five years
i was smart enough to
exit that i was part of the dotcom boom
then i thought the other three
companies had not done much over that period of time
i said okay you
hit the big time it won
it doesn t really matter for no good reason really
i
sold the other three companies at 2000 including kotak
of course if i had
just kept the 3000 dollars in kotak i would have about 600 000 today
but
just to go back to kotak they were a very small broker
goldman sachs at
the time had taken a 20 stake in them because again i think like me they
were very impressed with them
the key thing that happened to them was
in 2003 in 2003 they got a banking license
in india it is really hard to get
banking licenses
i mean the reserve bank has issued very few banking
licenses to private banks and kotak today has become one of the largest
private banks in india
they have executed really well and that is where the
bulk of their upside has come from
but the company has spawned many
adjacent businesses and they have acquired a few businesses and gone
from there
i told you most companies do not have the dna to do
spawning
spawning is an unusual kind of dna especially successful
spawners
for example some of you may be familiar with chipotle which is
a very successful mexican chain here in the us
i don t think they have
entered china yet but mcdonald s actually spotted chipotle when they just
had about 20 or 30 stores in denver in colorado
i think they took a 20 or
30 stake in chipotle and then later mcdonald s felt that it was a distraction
for them to own this business
chipotle had grown a lot
it had gone from
20 30 stores to a few hundred stores
mcdonald s had done really well with
the investment
they could clearly see that there was a long runway ahead
but they felt it was a distraction
they divested that stake and of course
chipotle has been a major home run for them so mcdonald s is kind of a
company where they from a dna perspective are all in on the mcdonald s
brand and they have innovated inside mcdonald s
for example breakfast
was an innovation drive through was an innovation the big mac was a big
innovation the mcmuffin and most of these innovations came from their
franchisees but mcdonald s basically you can say the opposite of alibaba
or an amazon
they don t do very well having multiple brands or businesses
they just want to be all in on mcdonald s and do that really well and that
works well for them
they are classically a non spawner
another one is
ford
ford had many years ago invested and bought land rover and
jaguar and then when alan mulally came in as a ceo he felt traction
because he noticed that most of the ford executives were driving land
rovers and jaguars and not really driving ford cars because they were
getting employed discounts on all the brands
he really wanted to focus
only on the ford brand
in 2009 he got rid of these two companies and
actually they are decent companies
they have very strong brands built
over probably close to a century or more
most businesses are not good at
spawning
in fact these are two examples of businesses that actually got
rid of what would have been adjacent businesses just because they felt it
was a distraction
some other examples of non spawners costco is a great
example of a non spawners
it executes really well
i mean if you compare
costco to walmart walmart has spawned quite a bit
they have a number
of formats of stores and operations globally and they have a number of
formats even in the us
moutai is also you can say very singularly focused
in and around the core of moutai brand and such
one of the things that
spawning does which makes it very good from an investing point of view
is capitalism is very brutal
every company is eventually going to die
it is
just the nature of capitalism
even for the strongest businesses there will
come a time when alibaba will not be around
amazon will not be around
because if you just study the history of businesses that were dominant 50
years ago a hundred years ago they are not with us today
ge and ibm were
good strong spawners
if they had not done spawning they would have
died a long time ago
spawning extended the runway of these companies
microsoft originally was just making compilers
they had a basic compiler
they were a compiler company
from there they went into becoming an
operating system company
they actually bought the company that
became ms dos
it would just be a shadow itself without spawning
because all these things that they have done is all add on to the core
business
spawning basically keeps the mothership young and healthy
it
has a lot of advantages including i already told you about tax advantages
some rules on spawning investing is that you can probably study these
statistics in china but if i look at the united states in the last 20 years there
were 3700 ipos in the us
only nine businesses with an ipo in the last 20
years have exceeded a hundred million market cap now
if you just make a
simple assumption that a business that you invest in will never get to more
than a 50 billion market cap if you just made that assumption then by
inversion you get a couple of rules
if you want a 10 bagger 10 times your
money out of a business it means you can t really buy a business which is
more than a 5 billion market cap
if you want to buy a hundred bagger then
you really can t buy a business that has more than a 500 billion market cap
the important thing with these hundred baggers and 10 baggers
if you look
at any public company or most public companies pretty much around the
world almost all of them have been hundred baggers
at some point most
of the hundred baggers is usually captured while they were still private
once they come public they may not be small enough where they can go a
hundred times
but the earlier you can get to these businesses the more
likely it is that you can get to 10 times your money or a hundred times your
money
if we look at a business like alibaba today it has 800 billion market
value can alibaba be a hundred bagger in 20 years
anything is possible
but it is probably unlikely because you are talking about something like 80
trillion dollars
it is a really large number and we don t even have businesses
anywhere in the world that are more than 3 trillion
even much more than
2 trillion
catching multi bagger early is important but also you have to
remember that the earlier you go in a company s life the wider the range of
outcomes
if i invest in moutai today the path is relatively narrow in terms
of outcomes but if i go into a very early stage business the range can be
quite wide
there is an art and science here in terms of making sure you
have enough fractions
what i call the pabrai s spawning rules which i just
came up with a few days ago is make an assumption that no business you
invest in will ever exceed a 50 billion market cap
if you want to make 10
times your money you go buy below 5 billion
if you want to make more
than hundred times your money you go buy below 500 million
what i
found about spawning is that spawning is not a trait that you can easily
screen for automatically
you can run a screen for low pe you can run a
screen for low price to book and you can run a screen for a lot of
quantitative metrics about a company
it is generally at least from what i
have found it is not obvious what business is a spawner or is not a spawner
until you spend at least a little bit of time looking at the business
once you
look at the business with a little bit of more detail then you can get to the
nature of the spawning
are they a non spawner or are they a spawner
if
they are a spawner stronger spawner are they okay
does it have strong
spawning dna or not
one of the things i want to get to in my portfolio
eventually is a portfolio that is only spawners and ideally a portfolio that is
only apex spawners and ideally a portfolio which is only apex spawners
where every company in the portfolio is a hundred billion market cap
that
to me would be the holy grail
we have to look at does it have strong
spawning dna does it have a great capital allocator running it
what i found
about spawning is that you don t need to make heroic assumptions
even a
500 million or 300 million dollar business will have enough tread marks in
the past from the time they were private and when they were public which
will make it obvious to you that this company has spawning dna or doesn t
have spawning dna and the nature of that dna
three businesses in the
portfolio were great spawners and they are all below a billion market cap
recently i found a fourth one which is below 400 million and had a strong
spawning dna and a very long history
you could easily tell what has been
going on in that business
of course the hunt is on to find more of these
one of the reasons i am speaking to peking u is my email address is on this
presentation the last slide
please send me spawners
i am desperate for
spawners
okay so set it and forget it
that is really what we want to do
we want to get to a portfolio of maybe five to 10 spawners
i love this quote
by thomas phelps and i am probably guilty of making a lot of errors
he
says for an individual institution really out to make a fortune in the stock
market it can be argued every sale is a confession of error
actually if we
are doing our jobs right what we really want to do is we want to become
silent minority partners with jack ma or with sam walton all with jeff
bezos
we want to find these people we want to find them early and then
we want to ride with them as long as they are riding
that is the holy grail
then my friend nick sleep i love this quote this is a quote nick put in his
last email to me which is a few weeks ago
he said that truly brilliant
investors weren t investors they were entrepreneurs that didn t sell
he
brought up sam walton in this quote
in fact one of the things i would
encourage a professor to do is to see if you can get nick sleep to speak to
you guys
nick sleep ran the nomad investment partnership i think in 2013
they were managing about 3 billion dollars
the entire portfolio probably
90 plus percent of it was in three stocks
it was in amazon costco and
berkshire hathaway
maybe 60 or 70 of the portfolio was amazon
if you
look at 2013 i think at that time amazon was around 300 a share
nick
wrote to his investors in early 2014 that he was shutting his partnership and
he said look we own three stocks 10 years from now we will own these
exact same three stocks
my partner zach and i are not going to make any
decisions or sell anything or buy anything by selling any of these three
positions
we quite frankly don t want to sit here and write letters to you
for the next 10 years
what we are doing is we are shutting the partnership
we are returning all your money and we recommend to you that you just
put the money in the three stocks and don t pay any fees to anyone
my
guess is both of them nick and zach probably had let us say a couple of
hundred million each that they had made as with the carry and all that
when they shut down nomad i think that s how that couple of hundred
million was invested
it was in these three stocks
it is mostly still sitting in
these three stocks
you can just calculate how well they have done
they ve
probably beaten every professional manager out there since then
an entire
portfolio composed of 5 to 10 great spawners at reasonable prices are likely
to do very well
you can t easily screen for spawners quantitatively
but
then like buffett says why should it be easy to get rich
it s worth the
effort and not all will get to nirvana but this approach can handle several
duds
if we look at nick sleeps three positions berkshire hathaway costco
and amazon
berkshire actually has underperformed the s p 500 for quite
a while
costco has probably done maybe a little bit better but nothing to
get overly excited about
but amazon was the one that really blew the doors
off
when you have a portfolio of spawners maybe five to tens you could
do really well with just a couple of them hitting home runs
this is an
approach that can tolerate more than a few dads
actually it is relatively
easy to avoid the duds because you can look at the track record
then the
question comes up when to get off the bus
i love this quote by charlie
the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt
don t exit until it is
absolutely clear that a secular decline has started
business does not go up
in a straight line
there are going to be ups and downs ignore these
temporary headwinds
but when you have absolute clarity that the business
is in a secular decline you can exit
even if you give up 50 you sell at 50
from the peak because it would take a while for the market and you to figure
out that there is a problem here
because you have had such a long run for
such a long time it doesn t matter
the return is still going to be good
if you
find a long runway and you are a little late at getting off the bus it is not
going to be a problem
the important thing is not getting off the bus for a
temporary hiccup
quick word on conglomerates
in korea and japan we
had the chaebol s and keiretsu s and these actually were incredible
spawners but they are a little bit different in the sense that they were given
a lot of government help and they were almost assured of success because
imports were restricted licenses to competitors were restricted
they are a
different kind of spawner but they have done really well
if you invested in
these businesses early in their life like if you bought the chaebols in the
1980s or you bought in the keiretsu in the 1970s you would have done
extremely well
mature conglomerate is very different because it has
already scaled and it is unlikely to be a 100x from where they are at
we also
have a lot of fake spawners or spawners who lose their way ge and ibm are
two examples of companies that actually survived for more than a hundred
years but then lost their way
i had 200 bagger in the 1990s
cmgi was one
which is in the us and satyam was in india
they are both what i would call
fake spawners
i was lucky that i was able to get off the bottom close to the
peak in both of them
but cmgi for example was more than a 100x
but
then they were spawning dotcoms and eventually almost nothing worked
and the company disappeared
satyam actually had a real business and
then they built a dotcom on top of it
it would have been about a 25x for me
if i had collected what was truly owed to me
but i got more than 140x
because there was euphoria
then we had a bunch of fake spawners in the
99 2000 timeframe like internet capital group idea lab safeguard
scientific
you have to make sure that the spawners you are going into are
not fake
they are real and that they have some staying power
pretty much
every public company was or will be a hundred bagger
i already told you
this walmart had already given the walton family more than a 100x before
the 1970 ipo it gave them another 20 000x after the ipo
there was a long
runway there
you could have gotten on the bus for a long time
that is an
unusual spawner
companies like uber etc are unlikely to deliver a 100x
post ipo because it became public at 50 billion
you would need to get to 5
trillion which i would be sceptical about
that is the song and dance and
you see my email address there to send me the spawners
i think we can
open up to questions
thank you
jiang great
thank you
student yeah thank you
you have a very great insights about the spawners mr
pabrai
you mentioned that by looking at the histories one can find clues
about whether a company has the dna of spawning
my question here is
according to your experiences how long on average does it takes to
discover that a company at its early stage has this kind of dna
mohnish that is a good question
it will vary by company
but what i have found is
that some of these companies that i have invested in were founded maybe
more than 20 years ago
i won t name these because i am still buying them
but i think the one in japan was founded in 1985 and i think they went public
around 2003
the founder was 25 years old when he started the company
and now he is 55
he is a young 55 and the business is very non japanese
in the way it runs and the kind of things he has done
he is an innovative
guy
there is a very long history there
i mean there is a 30 year history that
i could look at in that business
it is very obvious that spawning is very core
to the dna
i think what you can do is if you do not obviously see spawning
in the dna of the business and it doesn t need to be a 30 year old business
it can be obvious in 10 years
it can even be obvious in five years
it is just
that you can see that relatively quickly in some businesses
but i would just
say that if you said that i am going to have a portfolio which is only a
spawner portfolio and i am only going to invest when it is very obvious to
me that they have great spawning dna and i also put upper limit on the
market cap
there is a quote from the upanishads
the upanishads are these
holy scripture books in india which are probably written about 3000 years
ago
the full quote is as is your wish so is your will and as is your will so is
your desire and as is your desire so is your deed
then the punchline your
deepest desire is your destiny
if you truly want something like you are in
love with some girl and she doesn t care about you but if you truly want
that person and you purely and totally focus on that it will happen
the
same thing with the hunt for spawners if you say that it has to fit the
following criteria there are 50 000 stocks globally thousands in china
if
you just systematically go through that you only need if you can only find
one in a year that is enough
one a year is good you don t need too many
you have so much time to find one and then that is okay
student okay
thank you
mohnish all right
student thanks for the great presentation
that was a really interesting perspective
what helps you identify spawn is apart from their say mna their spawning
history is management an important factor that you look at and how do you
identify a good management that might turn the company into spawner
for example for amazon probably having jeff bezos as a ceo was pretty
important for the company to turn into spawner
mohnish yeah
for me it is a very new framework
it is just a few weeks old probably
the framework is still evolving and in fact you are the guinea pigs i want to
test the framework with
that is good
what i have found so far is
historically when i looked at businesses let us take a business like alphabet
alphabet when they release their financial the quarterly results of their
annual report they talk about other bets
they have a section called other
bets and they make all these investments in these other bets
historically
when i looked at a business like alphabet i would just take the other bets
and ascribe a zero value to them
because i would say who knows what is
going to happen over here
i would say that let us put it this way it was
maybe not an explicit value assigned to it but i said okay this is upside
without the downside
i just say okay it is good to have that but i really
can t right
because these are too much embryonic and who knows what
is going to happen with these things
now when i look at alphabet i don t
look at it that way
it becomes very clear
when i look at a company like
alphabet it is a spawner very clear
there is no ambiguity about it
not only
do i know it is a spawner but i can also tell which categories of spawner
they are right
i can see if have they bought embryos and grown them or
have created businesses of their own which are very different
google
started with only search right and then they bought android android was
not created by google
android was bought and then they scaled android
youtube was bought and they scaled youtube
some things they have
grown in house and some things they have bought and scaled
you can
clearly look at the categories of what they have done and now you can say
okay it is very obvious alphabet is an apex spawner it is very obvious
you
can say that about alibaba very obvious tencent and baidu you can say it
about all of them
these are very obvious because once you have the
framework you can put the categories and you are done right
but what is
also useful is that you look at smaller businesses
some of you may have
heard of chamath with his million followers whatever he has on twitter
chamath is spawning spacs right
the special purpose acquisition
companies and what he is saying is that he has one for every letter of the
alphabet
i was looking yesterday at a company with the ticker symbol is
ipob okay
he has ipoa ipob ipoc
these are all public companies
he
said they will go all the way to ipoz
it is very obvious that chamath is a
spawner
now the problem is there is no mothership
i mean i want to
invest in the mothership right
chamath i want to invest directly with him
not the ipob because i don t know if ipob will make it or not
chamath is
going to do really well because he is getting these facts going
probably
more than half or two thirds of them may not work but we don t need a
large number of them to work because they are going into such high
potential areas
for example ipob is a company the name is open door
and they are doing something which i am not sure whether it will work or
not
they are basically trying to disrupt the way homes are bought and sold
in the us
instead of me listing a home for sale they will just come and say
i will give you the cash today and you are done
you don t have buyers come
and look at your home and disrupt your life and all of that
we will give you
5 less than the market price but you don t deal with anything and you are
done in three days
they are able to do billions of dollars worth of home
purchases doing this
now i don t know whether this business eventually
works or doesn t work but it is one of his bets right
i think it becomes
relatively easy once you have
in the past i did not have the spawner
framework
when i didn t have the spawner framework i would just look at
google s other bets and just say oh we don t know
now i know that if
the company has spawned dna like google if google was less than a 500
billion market cap or even a 5 billion market cap i would want to invest in
that because i can say that it is in their dna
i mean they are giving one day
in a year to employees to do whatever they want
it is in their dna to create
new businesses right
i think it becomes very obvious when you look at a
lot of companies with that framework in mind
you can tell it is obvious that
they are a spawn or they are not a spawner
student okay thanks a lot
perhaps a quick follow on question if that is fine
how do
you then evaluate that spawning part of the business
how would you
evaluate google s extra bets because i guess doing a discounted cash flow
is pretty difficult on that
mohnish i would say you still can t value it but what you would be willing to do is
pay more for the rest of the business
student okay
mohnish previously i would have taken an approach saying other bets at zero i want
for free
i am not paying for it
now that i understand that dna is like that i
am willing to pay something for the dna
student okay that makes sense
so you make a normal
mohnish so you can say that okay let us say the business has the value of for
example pieces that you can value
these other bets would be zero
you
might say i will give them 5 10 billion for that other piece
student thank you
mohnish because zero might be too extreme
student okay that makes sense
thanks a lot
student hi mr
pabrai thank you for sharing
i think the key is really knowing who is
a spawner and who is a fake one
early on in your research what is the
common like culture or management style that you found among the
successful spawners
you listed a few companies but can you give us a
company that you thought was a spawner at the beginning but over time
you found that it was actually not
mohnish well i actually invested in a fake spawner in 1995 and the end result was i
made 140 times my money and now it was a hundred times my money
i put
a hundred thousand i got 10 million out
god loves me because after i sold
the stock it crashed and burned not before i sold it which was great
but
cmgi was a business that was an internet incubator
in 1999 in that
timeframe there were a number of businesses created which were all
internet incubators
ideal lab was one safeguard scientific was another
one cmgi was another one internet capital group with another one
there
were a bunch of these and a number of these were public companies
because i was in the it business you can say i was like two steps ahead of
the rest of the market not very far ahead just a little bit ahead
i could see
that on the internet i think it was in 93 or 94 that i saw whitehouse gov
the
first website i ever saw was in 93 whitehouse gov
i was just looking at the
world wide web and all that at that time and i could see that this thing could
be transformational
at that time i was saying i know the internet will be
big
i have no idea who the winners are going to be
what have i invested in
a company that just keeps spawning these companies and we don t need a
high hit rate
if you are paying very little for the mothership at the time i
invested in cmgi i was not paying much more than cash for the business
it
was not really understood by the market
as they started creating these
dotcom which eventually didn t go anywhere the market got very excited
about these businesses
just like they are excited now about these spacs
those spacs may have legs we don t know we will see how it goes
then
the valuations became so extreme that i just felt that this is in bubble
territory
now i couldn t still tell in 2000 whether their businesses were
making it or not
i just felt that the valuation was ridiculous
i got off the bus
i think if you are riding curves and especially if you are riding flavor of the
day curves it may be hard to be able to tell which one is a fake and which
one is not a fake
for example the year 2020 is the year of the spacs
everyone has a spac clearly there is when you have that type of stuff
happening it is likely that there is a bubble there
it is likely that a lot of
those will not go anywhere
but it also could be possible that if you could
find a way to invest in mothership like i would like to invest in chamath if i
can find a way to do it cheaply not the spacs he is creating but directly
him without paying high premium that would be interesting
i think what
you can do if you want to make sure that you avoid the fake ones is don t
take flyers on these things where you can t tell
set a high bar saying it has
to be obvious it is not fake
for example i have these four investments in
these four spawners
i don t think any of them are fake because they have
such a long history
we will see but i don t know how many of them will
actually go to 10x or 100x
we will have to see what happens there
i am
pretty sure at least one or two of them will get there
student sorry
for these four companies that you own the spawners what would
you say is the common factor a commonality among the management
style like philosophy or their management style that makes you believe
that
mohnish yeah the common element across all of them is that there is a long history
that i could study about management
i could look at their behaviour and
what they have actually executed over a very long period of time
i think in
the case of the japanese company i could see 30 years
some of the other
companies i am able to see at least 10 15 years of history which is a lot to
gives you a lot of data on that
it becomes obvious if the business doesn t
have more than five or 10 years of history then you have to be able to get
that level of history on the ceo or leader what they have done in the past
you have to have at least 10 15 years of history on the leader
student i see
on just on a practical side if we look at let s say facebook google
tencent or alibaba and if we want to pick them up before there were 5
billion us dollar in market cap or even 10 billion us dollar in market cap i
think at the time they were not spawners
they were very small single
business with very highly uncertain future
i am curious the holdings that
you hold these are long history but still with long history of spawning but
still like under 10 billion is that the case
mohnish yeah
the thing is that if i were to give you their names it would be
underwhelmed because they are not in the sexy businesses that google and
tencent are in
okay
i think google tencent alibaba is flavor of the day
everyone loves them
i would say that yes i agree with you completely well
i won t say agree completely
i would say a business like google was not a
spawner but it was not a fly by night company when it came public
when
it came public they dominated search and they had disrupted the previous
players completely on search
they were sitting at 90 market share
you
could easily tell with adwords that their revenue potential just on search
was huge
google would have been a bet that would have been based on
search right
it would not have been a bet based on spawning
but then
what you could have done if you had this presentation at the time is that as
they started to spawn then you would know that this is a keeper don t ever
sell this
another way to use a framework is that you may invest in a
business that does not have any trade marks that it is a spawner and it turns
into one
i mean i would say that probably when li lu made first
investment in byd very early it was not a spawner but then he suddenly
enters the car business which is completely different than the business they
were in in the past and probably a lot of people are deeply sceptical of that
move and he made that work and then you can now see that he can do all
of that
i think sometimes you may stumble into a spawner in the
sense that you invest in a company which is a one trick pony but it turns
into a multi and when that happens you have a way to kind of put a
framework around that and say okay i can keep this business because now
it has spawning dna
student got it
thank you very much
mohnish sure
student thank you mr
pabrai for such great inspirations
i am just wondering when
you try to identify new spawner are you concerned if companies may get a
little bit too excited in burning cash or get distracted along the way instead
of really other things they are truly good at
for example if mcdonald s tried
to be a spawner in the early days is it possible that it may just not get to
where this at today
mohnish yeah one of the core dna traits of a great spawner is they are not going to
make large early bets
they will be unwilling to bet the farm
i mean this is
classically what entrepreneurs do
what they want is a free lunch
if we
study byd s entry into n95 masks for example it is a completely different
business than where they were in the future or in the past but i am almost
certain if i study the numbers i would find that if that completely failed it
would be around error for them
it would not affect maybe 90 of
everything else that they have
the key trait a great spawner has to have is
that when they make a bet and amazon has this in the dna the bets are
not very large bets
they do know a lot of capital until they see traction
they
will put some money at it then if they see there is something happening
they will put some more money
if they see something s happening they
will put some more money and they will keep going from there
the
moment they start seeing that this is not working they will pull back
if i
look at amazon with their fire phone for example they were very excited
about it but when they saw there is no traction they buried it and they
moved on
the bet size relative to the mothership for a good spawner is the
bet is always going to be small
no good spawner is going to bet the
mothership on an unproven flyer
that is one of the dna things you can look
for
when they start doing these things are they doing them on a small scale
or are they doing them on a large scale
i think that there is a lot to be said
for companies that don t do spawning
spawning is hard
spawning requires
you to have an approach where you can watch five or 10 things and be good
at watching five or 10 things
most humans are not good at that
they need
to be focused on one thing
very few companies can actually be good
spawner companies
if i look at a company like costco costco is the classic
unspawner one format and they have just stuck to that format forever and
they will not change that format and that works well
it is a great
investment it has worked out great for a long time
i think you have to make
sure that the spawner that you are looking at is not one that is making erratic
huge bets
i would say that i don t know whether tesla is a good example
but if we look at tesla one of the things that are bothersome to me about
tesla is elon doesn t care about money
he cares about a lot of other things
he cares about dying on mars just not on impact
but he does not care
about money
he just sold all his homes
he doesn t even care about home
the thing is that capital allocation by someone like that is kind of
bothersome to me right
because he could make a really large bet on
something unproven that would be entirely within what elon would do
it
is not the way jeff bezos would operate
i think you have to understand that
student mr
pabrai thanks for sharing and its a quite unique hammer and
perspective
i have two questions
first one is i am very curious about the
persistence of spawning because most of these founders of authentic
spawners like facebook or alibaba are still starting but how about the
company s controlled by professional executives
the second question is
how to balance the whole investment structure and match to avoid the risk
of with hammer and the word looks like a nail proposed by charlie munger
thank you
mohnish yeah i think that you are absolutely right that the spawning dna is very
critical
when i look at the munger i have invested in or accidentally invested
in they are founder led
the founder has the dna and the founder still is
young or relatively young and still running with the same dna and yes you
have to study that
you have to make sure that you have enough data that
the next generation can run things
in some cases the next generation can
be better than the previous generation
for example in india one of the
largest companies is reliance industries
the second generation is running
it and the second generation is better than the founder
the son is better
than the father
it would have taken some time to understand that is the
case and i did not
i think if there is a transition that has taken place to
professional management and the spawning took place while there was a
founder it is a red flag
you have to have enough data on the professional
manager whether they understand that
one of the things we don t know
we would have to see that when a business like amazon transitions to the
next leader the next leader has the spawning dna deeply entrenched into
the business so much that the next leader has that hardwired and ready to
go
we will have to see if that is actually the case
i did not get your second
question
can you repeat the second question
student okay
the second question is how to balance the whole investment
structure and to avoid the risk of hammer the world looks like a nail
it is
proposed by charlie munger
mohnish yeah i think the thing is that you have to make sure you are not fooling
yourself because you are the easiest person to fool
take a step
back
one of the things charlie munger had told me he said it is always
good to have somebody to bounce your investment ideas with someone
you can talk to about your investment ideas
i said you mean like you had
warren
he said i did not always have warren
he said sometimes i would
discuss my ideas with somebody else not always warren buffett but he
said that it was in investing it is very important and the person you should
discuss your ideas with needs to be a peer
it cannot be like an employeeemployer relationship because there the hierarchy may make the candid
sharing of perspectives harder but if you can share your ideas with a peer
who can be honest and candid with you that is one way to avoid thinking
everything looks like a nail
you have to avoid making sure you don t think
everything looks like a nail
student i am really wondering if this whole spawning picture is like the hammer for
right now because maybe not every company can be classified as spawners
or non spawner
mohnish i think that if you look at every business let us say we look at hundred
random businesses and we decide that we want to start separating them
into spawner and non spawner
i think what you are going to find is it is not
a binary 01 okay
you are going to find that there are companies that are
complete non spawners extreme non spawner and there are companies
that are extreme spawner
throughout the continuum you will find
companies across that continuum
there would be companies that would
have what i would call strong spawning dna and then with the others that
would have weak spawning dna
it would be a continuum
it wouldn t be a
binary switch if you looked at different businesses
as long as you can
identify where you want to be you say that spawning has to be a strong
part of the business then of course i think you will be able to separate
them
the other thing is that just like in baseball there is no call like it is
okay to let a spawner go which is it is okay to miss a spawner
it is
problematic to think something is a spawner but it is not
if you miss an
alibaba you miss a google that is okay but don t bring in mcdonald s
thinking it is a spawner when it s not
that is more problematic
i think what
i am saying is that it should be obvious that a company has strong spawning
dna
i think it is pretty obvious to tell that in my opinion
the other thing
about this is that i have a hypothesis which is a hypothesis today because i
don t have the data but i would hypothesize that if i had a portfolio of 10
spawners carefully selected 10 bet in each spawner and i didn t touch it
for a long time i think the odds are good
if you have done your selections
properly three or four may not be really good and that is all you need
if you
get two or three that are really good it will make up for all the mistakes that
you can come up with in all the other ones
if you just identify a few that
gives you very strong returns as long as you don t lose much money on the
others you will be okay
i think it is an approach that can tolerate you being
wrong
business is difficult
trying to forecast the future of a business is
difficult no matter what
we may be wrong on some of these spawners and
that is perfectly okay we don t need to be right on all of them
he really was
absolutely right on one business and that is all
the first amazon shares he
bought were at 30 a share in 2002 right
he never sold and he bought at
30 he bought a hundred dollars he bought a 200 he even bought a 300
right
it didn t matter there were about a dozen companies in his portfolio
this was the only consequence that mattered
it didn t matter what else was
happening
student thank you for sharing everything so generously
i have two questions
my
first question is because the past 10 years were a bull market
does same
make you change into the framework of spawner
what if the past 10 year
have been the bear market would you have a different thinking or change
your philosophy and a quick follow up on cmgi because you somehow
capture a whole hundred percent x
if the position was not 10 bet if they
were a hundred percent bet would you be too worried about the position
or you somehow not be able to capture the whole process
i know there
was a mistake because you mentioned that you said you should have sold
at 5x
my question is does that position sizing make you become less
worried about the position so you could catch the whole process
mohnish those are good questions
with cmgi actually what happened at that time
was in 1994 my net worth was 1 million
it was a 10 bet
a hundred
thousand dollars
i let that bet run for five years and it just kept going up
i
saw they were spawning all these companies and i said maybe some of
these will hit we will see
eventually what happened is the entire portfolio
was worth about 14 or 15 million
close to about 15 million
cmgi was sitting
at about two thirds of the entire portfolio
but i was not a professional
money manager then
it was my own money and i really didn t feel or care
that there was this degree of concentration
i was paying more attention to
it as it became a larger and larger portion of my net worth and that is why i
eventually when it got to about 10 million i looked at the numbers i said
this thing this thing could blow up with the
i am not sure
at that point i
felt like 10 million will change my life
okay
guaranteed to change my life
right
i said let us ring the register and put the money in the drawer and we
are set with that
that was part of the thinking but i didn t really want to do
anything with it earlier
i think your second point about the last 10 years and
so on in my opinion i think spawning transcends markets just like great
businesses transcend markets
i think that if we find a great entrepreneur
who is executing well those businesses can do well regardless of the
markets we are in
as long as we are able to invest them at a reasonable
valuation the bear market might make it easier to find those kinds of
businesses because no one is interested
student one more question
mohnish go ahead
student my question is about short term suffering
because in 1970 charlie munger
has suffered his investment portfolio was suffering a lot
mohnish you also
said before that every time you buy something things go down by like 20
my question is how do you feel about lost short term suffering
mohnish there is a saying if wealth is lost nothing is lost
if health is lost something
is lost
if character is lost everything is lost
we are just talking about wealth
if you buy a stock and it goes down 20 which happens to every stock i
buy by the way you are not buying a stock you are buying a business right
before you buy the business you have to understand what that business
does and what that business is worth
then you are not going to get
distressed
in fact you should get happy if it has gone down you can maybe
get some more than what you had before
it has never bothered me stock
prices move around and all that
i think it is in the nature of auction driven
markets that is we are going to see these swings
if you just look at the
shanghai stock market and you throw a dart if you have a page with all the
stock names and just throw a dart at any name just look at the 52 week
range of prices on that stock
it will be 70 to150
or 30 to 70 right
i mean
every stock in one year has a range which is so wide
if we look at home
prices over one year the change is 5 or 10 or 15
it is not 50
auction
driven markets are going to give you very wide swings both ways
we can
take advantage of those swings
it is just in the nature of auction driven
markets that you are going to have movement and volatility
there is just
part of the game
student hi mohnish how are you
thank you very much again for sharing your very
candid thoughts with us
my question is a little bit different from the
previous ones
the first question is related to berkshire hathaway you are
quite close with warren buffett and charlie munger
any thoughts about
berkshire s latest trade
for example dumping costco and selling many
banks stock etc and the second question i am not sure is proper not so
feel free to share whatever you can
your portfolio seems quite
concentrated iemu and srg from some public materials
you had srg in
2017 and now you loaded quite heavily from the second quarter this year
any reason inside that you could share with us
thank you very much
mohnish all right
any data i have about costco or the banks is not coming from
warren or charlie it is just what i think the costco sale is a complete
surprise to me
there is very few companies that charlie loves more than
costco
every time i meet him in fact the last time i had dinner with him
we spend so much time talking about costco
every time i meet him we
talk about costco like he was asking me if i visit costco and i told him now
costco delivers to my home
i don t have to go to costco they deliver to my
home
he said oh then you have to pay too many fees
please go to costco
to get cheaper price
anyway i have no idea why they sold costco
the only
thing i would say is investors buy stocks for only one reason
they sell
stocks for 100 reasons
okay
we cannot tell anything about what someone
is thinking when they sell a stock
we can tell something about what
someone is thinking when they buy a stock
all right
just keep that in mind
because there are many different reasons people could be selling
the bank
stocks well they are really good at banks so they would know better what
is going on there
but i know that warren from the actions i have seen
deeply loves bank of america and maybe not so much wells fargo anymore
just from the actions i am seeing regarding my own portfolio what gets
reported is the us positions
we have two holdings in the us micron and
seritage
those show up in the quarterly filings
i don t really have a whole
lot to say about either one
i mean i would say that seritage micron we
have held for i think about maybe more than a couple of years now but
seritage we bought a stake in the second quarter of this year
the stock
price was down 70 80 from where it was a few weeks before that
maybe
that would give you some clue as to why i might be interested but i do want
to clarify that seritage is not a spawner
in fact seritage is what i would call
as unspawned because they keep selling some assets to keep the ship
going
it is the opposite of a spawner because it was bought in an era when
i did not have the spawner framework
but i am still very happy with that
investment
terence thank you mohnish i really appreciate your time
i have really two quick
questions
the first one is you mentioned you were starting your own
business while working full time after work and then spending on
weekends
do you think you would become the investor you are today
without that entrepreneurial and operating experience
my second quick
question is that you emphasize on the circle of competence right
do you
think physical location is a big part of that
because for example even
though i am chinese but i live in the us i feel like i understand the business
dynamics much more about us than china
do you think the physical
location matter obviously you and warren and charlie invested in
companies without probably visiting those countries
what s your thoughts
on that as well
thank you
mohnish yeah those are good questions terence
yes i think it is a very big
advantage if you do business before in fact specifically the spawner
framework
i am not sure i could have come up with the framework if i had
not run businesses before
because when i was running my it company and
i thought about it when i was doing the spawner framework i was doing
spawning in that business and it was adjacent spawning right and i saw how
little capital it took some brain power but it took very little capital and
some of these bets that i made where the amount invested was so small
but they grew quite significantly
i saw the power of spawning directly and
that is when i realized that i have to pay attention
when i transported my
own personal experience into some of these public companies and started
looking at them i could look at them from the same lens as i had looked at
definitely i think it is a huge advantage if you have run businesses before
and such
i think there is no substitute for that
the second is that i think in
terms of the circle of competence and where to invest and so on i think you
have to have a very high conviction
anytime you are making investments
you have to have a very high conviction
you cannot be concerned that you
don t understand something or whatever
the thing about investing is that
the size of the circle of competence that we have is irrelevant
what is more
relevant is that we stay within the circle
i think i have talked even in this
class about charlie s friend john arriaga who only invests in real estate
within two miles of the stanford campus
he is a billionaire he only
understands not only real estate but within real estate he only understands
real estate in a very small area
if someone told him to invest in real estate
in los angeles or another state or anywhere he would just not be
interested
it did not stop him from becoming very wealthy
if you look at
all these entrepreneurs like sam walton or ray kroc or any of these
companies jim sinegal with costco their expertise is very narrow
expertise but they became very wealthy
it is the same in investing
the
important thing in investing is to stick to things that you are really good at
and things that you really understand well
that is where you will get the
biggest edge and that is how you should approach it
yi lu mr
pabrai in your last experience what is your biggest mistake in investing
and what influences did it have on you
mohnish well i think the area of investing that gave me the most trouble was
companies with leverage
i had many investments over the last 26 years that
did not work well and a good number of them are concentrated on
companies that either had too much debt or they were financial services
companies where leverage was inherent in their model
i have been trying
to make sure that the companies and businesses i m investing in do not
have a big dependency on debt and leverage
i still have businesses in the
portfolio even today that have leverage
i think they are okay but we will
find out
maybe i am like an alcoholic who has not given up alcohol yet but
i definitely want to minimize a good business should not need debt to do
well
good businesses can do well without debt
jiang all right
already two hours it s about midnight in california
i think we have
a very wonderful two hours listening to your talk and your question and
answer actually your first talk to us is through online like in 2016
the
second one is on site here at the campus in 2017
now we are in 2020 the
third time online
i hope next year you will come back to peking university
campus to speak to this class again
mohnish yeah well that would be a pleasure and an honor i haven t gotten on an
airplane for about 10 months now and it will be very good to be able to
travel maybe i think may or june of next year onwards
in fact one of the
first trips i will be making to china so looking forward to that
thank you
jiang okay
i think when you visit china someone from this class will accompany
you like last time
mohnish yeah that will be wonderful
jiang this class took you to moutai
mohnish i am hoping some of your students will give me a chinese spawner tour of
everything below 500 million
jiang all right
okay
mohnish that is the goal
jiang okay
it also amazed me that value investors as successful as you still like
developing new ideas
although the title of your talks this time is the same
as last one but the content is brand new
is spawners as this is a new source
and new ideas new framework
i think this can also tell our students that
as a value investor never stop learning
mohnish yeah
i was not sure whether i should give this talk because it will mean i
will have more competition but it is okay
no problem
the plus side is i will
get feedback which will be helpful so that is great
jiang yeah
okay
mohnish thank you very much
thank you professor
wonderful
jiang let us see chang would you say something
chang yeah it is very inspiring to listen to this
as value investors we always have
to think about what kind of companies we are investing in and how they
can generate terms for us
right
when you mention about byd to us it is
more like a public venture company
they do have some very interesting
managerial and company type of competitive advantages that they
leverage on their manufacturing power and research capability that they
leverage on
they also made many bad investment decisions
like yeah
mohnish but i think one thing you probably have seen with byd is the individual bets
cannot sync the company
chang yeah that is right
mohnish the bets are sized so that you can have a high failure rate and it is okay you
don t need very many of them to work
if they work then they can scale
quite a bit
chang yeah
that is very important
the insight i learned the entrepreneurs how
they make investments you are totally right
they may bet that they did not
kill themselves that is very important
yeah
mohnish because i think that they are making such early stage bets that by
definition there is going to be a high failure rate
there is no way to avoid
the failure rate
it is going to be high
yeah but it also means that the ones
that work have huge runways
chang that is right
but the problem is a lot of time when we look at these types
of companies they are too expensive for us
mohnish you have to find the ones that the public doesn t understand
