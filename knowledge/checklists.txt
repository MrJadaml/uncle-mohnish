monish i learned about you reading checklist manifesto i understand you are a buffett and monger disciple you started a charity called the dakshana foundation with the goal of giving back your wealth to society admirable you are a glutton for tough questions you allow people to ask you questions a couple of times a month like this your ask to them is to make the questions as difficult as possible and avoid repeating questions that you ve had previouslywith that i ll start it off you know you re busy you have a lot of high return on investment uses of your time why do you agree to do ask me anything sessions i think the best way to learn is to teach i have a lineman method i have an ulterior motive basically i actually find many times that i feel wiser after some of these sessions because of some of the comments or questions or you know some of the push backs and such that s obviously one direct altria motive but althe second is that this community you know because of the legacy of buffett and monger and especially ben graham has a legacy of teaching and educating and generally i think the i would say the original practitioners and the best players in the field that s kind of the ethos they kind of laid down we re just kind of following that path it just started the credo of being a value investor i think that s great that thank youand for those that would like to ask questions for me to said just raise your hand with the the reactions or put in the chat and i will be glad tocall your name you re famous for checklistsif you were an allocator investing in a manager not necessarily investing in a company because i know that you don t necessarily talk about all the items on your checklist if you re investing in a in another investment manager what would be on that checklist i think actually finding a good investment manager is a lot harder than finding a good investment it is a challenge and i think there is a few things you can look for to try to put the odds in your favor one is i think you would i d be looking for aligned fee structure where there s kind of a win win on both sides you know i took my fee structure from warren buffett where we don t have any management fees it s only performance fees and it s after the first six percent every year goes to investors there s a sharing after the six percent the first thing i d look for is a fee structure that s it s that is aligned which itself would be a stumbling block in this industry the second is i d like to find a manager with a lot of skin in the game i would look for a large portion of their assets being co invested alongside me that not only do they gain from the fees but they alhave upside or downside based on their own assets that s the second thing i would look for the third thing i d look for is a relatively young person basically i think we need enough enough years to be able to look back at our track record but alenough years that someone could have a 20 year run there about probably i would say about mid 40s type age band would actually be ideal because if they ve been in the industry for from their early 20s then you ve got about 20 odd years of information to look back on the third would be the the age and then obviously the track record of what they ve actually done that would give you some data points and one more thing i would look for is where do they go where do they go fishing if you look at the u s public equities markets they re very picked over you have a lot of funds we have more mutual funds than than stocks in the us by some margin probably more etfs than stocks and there s many stocks where they have 30 analysts following that the what i would look for is what s the kind of game plan to not be fishing where everyone else is these were these are some of the things and then obviously we re looking for people with high integrity and people that you align with and who in their past track record demonstrated that they can do meaningfully better than the market without taking as much risk that s great i love to see your process as you go because you i think your checklist is historically notorious for just things being added as you go i think you said that your checklist was here then it s got to hear now it s now it s like here i saw you like thinking as you go you you said three things and you ended up with seven that s the way that goes bermita i see your hand is raised sure i wanted to ask a little bit about esgin my intro i mentioned how esg is one of the key pillars for our center here and i m curious to hear your thoughts on a few things one i think esg means different things to different people how do you define esg and do you incorporate it in your investment process i m not sure you re gonna like my answer but i think that it s a complicated area and we get to some we get to kind of some strange results for example i think in some list i saw they included exxon the excluded tesla i m kind of scratching my head about that one basically i think that it s we definitely want to look for businesses that are that are good for the ecosystem but there are albusinesses which we look at a company like exxon it s an essential very essential business for us to have the kind of quality of life and such that we desire we just can t banish every fossil fuel reducing company and say that life will still be great now we have a choice whether we invest in those or not and that s fine i do look at how companies conduct themselves and how they the choices they make but i don t overdose on it for example we ve had a i think this is our oldest investment it s we ve had this investment for eight and a half years it s a company actually got plants all over the world that provides inputs to the aluminum industry and the stuff they produce that is used by the aluminum industry to produce aluminum has a lot of discharge of gases and such and it s just part of the process the company has actually gone well beyond what is required by law in terms of reductions in emissions and on and they put in scrubbers and on that cost them several million dollars a year that their competitors don t do and they carry that cost if you just took a glance at that company or that industry and you were overdosed on esg you would just take a pass but i think when you peel the onion if you will then things look a little bit different i don t take the approach that i have to not invest in certain industries at all because of esg i just look at it kind of one more layer deeper in terms of what type of corporate citizens are we talking about actually that s great i love your answer you said i wouldn t like it but that s exactly what we re trying to do here basically dig a deeper dig a little bit deeper to incorporate it into the analysis thank you much for that okay great i see love you have your hand raised yep hey hey cameron nice to meet you and thanks promita for organizing it monish a big fan of yours and have read the dundo investor my question was more i guess you know i wanted to ask on the psychological side when you do have like let s say you start an investment in a certain position and things don t necessarily go to planwhat are sort of criteria that you re thinking of internally as you evaluate whether or not to stick with it or whether to double downand maybe the second question would be is where where are you going fishing these days i guess thanks actually one of the rules and i would say laws of the universe is everything i buy goes down in price and i m just resigned to the reality that it ll be going up till i buy it and then it proceeds to start going down especially after i ve taken a full position i m i think it s very common in my portfolio that we ll have positions that are recent positions that we ve taken and we have some loss on them and sometimes even our meaningful loss on them i think that s just kind of power for the course and the reality with the investment business is that john templeton said that the best investment analyst is going to be wrong one out of three times they re only going to be right two out of three times more more than likely it s more going to be wrong about half the time and the good news of this business is that even with a 50 error rate you can do extremely well well above market returns and such we we don t want to be using the stock price to instruct us we should be using the stock price to serve us and what should be instructing us is the fundamentals of the business and to the extent that something declines in price and we still have some dry powder to make it a full position it would not be the price that would drive that decision it would be more about what are the fundamentals it has something fundamental changed and that sort of thing we want to pay attention to all the data if something s gone through a price decline we want to understand why that is the case and whether there is some long term secular issue that we need to pay attention to but if it is you know something temporary or whatever then for the most part i ll ignore it and in terms of places to go fishing place that i found most productive last few years to go fishing in is in turkey and 85 percent annual inflation and everyone and their brother have an ex having exited the market in terms of foreign investors and local investors really having a very short holding period the turkish market is interesting because 80 percent of the entire market cap of turkey is either held by insiders or foreign institutional investors and that portion hardly trade the 20 that is held by turkish retail and token institution turns over every nine days and that s hyperactive and in most cases retail investors in turkey they want to invest at 10 o clock in the morning and make about 10 and exit at 2 pm and buffett says the stock market is the mechanism to transfer wealth from the active to the inactive in turkey what i find is a lot of the market participants aren t really looking at the fundamentals of the business and anytime you re you ve got a four hour or eight hour window that you re trying to hold something you re not really going to be concerned about what the earnings are even next quarter out the window in turkey there are a few businesses which are immune to the inflation either they have for example revenues in euros or dollars or they are in in businesses where they can pass on costs like a coke bottle or something there s a very small sliver of businesses i think inflation generally is bad news or equity investors but there s a small sliver of businesses in turkey which benefit from inflation or at least are neutral on it and since everything got thrown out with the bathwater those things got thrown out too and that s the place to go fishing for me great question what businesses benefit from inflation for example there s a there s a company in turkey i don t own this company but they export canned and bottled fruit juices all over europe and turkey has access to the european common market there s no tariffs or duties in or out this company has all their costs in lira turkish lira and all the revenues in u s and in fact what happened generally in a high inflation environment is that wages don t keep up one of the unfortunate effects is that the turkish people and we see the same thing here in the u s actually because we re not seeing wages keep up with inflation we re at eight or nine percent inflation and last and look like wages were going up like four or five percent and in turkey we have a similar situation where the wages aren t keeping up in euro or dollar terms every 10 percent decline in the lira increases these this company s profits by three or four percent we own a turkish airport operator they actually operate airports in eight different countries 15 different airports even the airports in turkey their revenues are all in euros basically even there you know their staff and some of the expenses are in lira and they have no impact from these types of things we alown a warehouse rental company in turkey and steel prices have an international price and concrete has an international price and city center real estate in a major city like istanbul has an international price and it s auto inflation index in the sense that those prices of those warehouses keep moving up probably in locks lockstep or ahead of inflation and their rents go up with inflation as well because it s written into the leases there are a few places to play probably i would say 95 percent of the market is not investable we just need a couple of ideas a year and we re good that s rightyou mentioned earlier the fact that there are more etfs and mutual funds and there are stocks in the u s andthat s a sign of the move towards passive over the years there was a good question from jim jones who is the actual founder of the alpha challenge which we were talking about earlier and he asked how much more inefficient does the market get for each point of market share that goes to passive versus active that is above my pay grade laughter no idea i think john bogle was asked this question about the move towards passive and at what point does it cause distortions and his answer was that we are still pretty far away from those points but i think it s getting i think when we start looking at some of the larger names the amount that is held by the different large fund houses and in etfs or index fund and on is pretty pretty sizable and and then you have you know you can add to the other indexers and such and then that adds to it as well but it s just not an area that i pay a lot of attention to i don t have too much insight i can give you on that it seems like it d be an advantage for for folks like you where you mentioned the difference between how active traders are in turkey and there s an advantage that you get to take because you re long term and inactive same kind of thing right that passive creates price inefficiencies that you can then arbitrage i think it it does create that though i would say that my general sense of the united states at this point is that it s a it s quite an efficient market and it s quite inefficient or efficient no it s quite an efficient market and it s a very picked over market even though we have large amounts of passive investments and such i don t see i don t see mispricing in the direction of undervaluation i do see mispricing in the direction of over valuation sometimes but far at least i haven t seen anything that is helpful to the active investor in the us with what s been going on it s good not that much help far that s great quincy i see you have your hand raised thank you i think this kind of goes up what you were just speaking about but in school we re taught about the efficient market theorybut then we see kind of these hundred plus bit movements by the market caused by a fed announcement some kind of macroeconomic data coming outand it kind of seems like the market is almost pricing stuff in you know on its toes or reacting more than pricing a lot of stuff ini was just kind of curious do you think that you know this current generation of investors those who started managing money in the last 10 to 15 years have been kind of blindsided by your prolonged period of free money and low ratesand it s not properly under and is underestimating kind of what lies ahead you know maybe a period of prolonged inflation or whatnot i think the way i look at it is that i don t particularly care about the market and what s going on at a index or market level and i think most investors are better off if they focus in a lot more on individual businesses and what s going on with the individual businesses and that s where you can find some inefficiency for example if you picked any random stock on the new york stock exchanges through a dart at all the stocks in the you know stock exchange and you just look at the 52 week range on any random stock it ll be a pretty wide range it might be like 50 to 100 and this will be like 50 to 100 in a benign environment with nothing going on you know the index has moved two percent a year or something it ll still be it ll you ll still see a range which is very wide and if you see another stock it ll be like 60 to 130 that sort of thing when you compare that to let s say for example the price of a home across the street and if you had a realtor friend who gave you a quote on that home every day and you ask them hey what s this homework today and then what s it for tomorrow change in a year would be maybe five ten percent max it might be less than five percent in most years but if that home were listed on some equity exchange we would see much wider price ranges on that over the year it would behave like the nyse stocks behave because of this larger degree of fluctuation that s the reason people like me can make a living is the market is undershooting or overshooting all the time and the fact that we have such wide ranges it s really in the nature of auction driven markets to serve of us this wider range of prices on assets that shouldn t really move that much in a year google is a certain kind of business and six months ago to a certain kind of business and six months from now it s a certain kind of business and why should the value be 50 60 percent off in those short periods especially when you re looking at long term discounting back cash flows over the long horizon to get the value of that business it just doesn t make much sense to the extent that the market missed prices by underpricing a business significantly we can benefit from that by buying it and take it from there auction driven markets can serve up really really incredible valuation from time to time i had mentioned turkey and i mentioned that warehouse operator when we invested in 2019 the market cap of that company was 20 million dollars and you could have very quickly liquidated the entire portfolio or 800 million or more and paid off the 200 million of debt and you would end up with at least 600 million we were looking at something that was priced at less than four percent of liquidation value in a negotiated transaction i m never going to be able to pick up a piece of real estate at even some of the most distressed situations i m never going to be able to pick up a piece of real estate at four percent and what the market priced three and a half years ago at 20 million it prices today at 270 million in dollars for whatever reason the market decided it s worth 13 14 times that now it s the same here warehouses and it s still undervalued and in fact what s happened is that because of all these russians and ukrainians that have come in i think that if they were to sell their footprint today my guess is they would get and they ve paid off most of the debt they would probably get somewhere north of a billion maybe a billion and a half somewhere in that range one to one point five billion we are at 270 million we re not at three percent anymore which are 25 we re 25 a lot more efficiently but they re still there s still some skin in the game there and that s particularly particularly the is a fun example for me because i think that the people who run that business are really good capital allocators and i think they ve done a bunch of smart things the last three and a half years and i think they ll keep doing smart things i think if i fast forward 10 or 20 years i think that business is probably in 2040 it would not surprise me if it s got a market cap of 10 billion that would not surprise me at all and focus i have is to spend all my time speaking to the unc flagler students and not touch the stock awesome that s just twiddle my thumbs for the next 18 years like rip van wrinkle i think i just need to go to sleep put your feet up on the desk exactly that s a that s an interesting point about how the market is pricing securities very oftenbut that s not a true reflection of valuehow often do you look at your p l and how long how often should managers on average look at their p l and you know does it cause bad behavior when they look at it on a daily basis i think one of my one of my principles is that when you find yourself at the bottom of a deep well you need to have a rope to get out what i mean by that is that if i go back to 2008 and 09 at that time i think was down like 65 67 percent on the peak from the peak in 2007 to the bottom in march 2009 we re probably down two thirds and i used to be managing like 600 million in 2007 and i was managing less than 200 million in 2009
and everything looked beat up right and what i did i think the rope i used at that time was i just created a spreadsheet which showed me what these businesses were worth and what the portfolio was worth and the portfolio is actually worth more than 600 million and i didn t fixate on all you know the market value is much and this and that because again we re not looking for the market to instruct us we have other plays to get instructed as you said and i think from march 2009 to december 2009 the funds were up like 135 and they kept going after that because we could just see we could see the businesses and we could see what it s worth even when we looked at this business in turkey erasers at 20 million i did all the due diligence i couldn t come up with a valid reason i asked myself whether the guys were crooks whether the everything was fraudulent whether those places actually existed i went and visited all the warehouses and i met the management and they look like perfectly honest people to me and i couldn t find anything wrong with it and we re not going to use the stock price to instruct us we re going to use fundamentals to instruct us how often do you look at your p l i don t fixate on stock prices i think that if i m not traveling or something i ll probably look at stuff once a day or a couple of times a day but sometimes i may not get to looking at valuations or whatever or even stock prices for one or more days at a time i usually try to at least take a peek once a day we don t have too many positions most of our funds have only eight or nine stocks it s pretty easy to tell what s going on gotcha you are a philanthropist and i would say that one of the more valuable things that you have beyond your net worth is your checklist which you are protective of when does that go into the public domain is the thing that you re giving away to society we may publish it at some point but i think the we i ve actually talked a fair bit about there s really no special secret sauce to my checklist i think if you saw it you might be a little bit disappointed oh it s simple but basically the way the checklist was created was i looked at investments that did not work out for great investors this is a relatively easy exercise to do because we have in the us we have 13f filing we can tell when somebody buys something we can altell when they sell something and we can come up with some average buy price an average sell price because it s happened during the quarter you can come up with approximately what somebody may have made or lost when they sold an investment if i have someone like warren buffett for example it s relatively easy to come up with a list which says okay look these are all the businesses that buffett invested in that were actually a realized loss at the end for example and the question i asked myself is that let s say us air was a company that buffett born along many years ago and it usa actually in the end did work hard because they had a preferred and such but let s say they they lost money on us air the question i would ask or ibm might be a better example right ibm was an example of what buffett bought and actually he had realized loss on that the question i would ask myself is okay when he made the investment in ibm what was the thesis and what was visible or easily visible at that time that was somehow missed by this great investor and and actually when you start looking at these companies and asking these questions it becomes really obvious and if i just stay on ibm for a second what ibm had done at the time warren bought this talk was that they had published five year advanced guidance clearly stating what their cash flows and revenues and type amount of buybacks were likely to be over the next five years and i think the mistake warren made was he relied very heavily on the document and he had no reason not to rely on that document because the people who put that document up were very high quality people they believed that document they weren t trying to snow investors or something but if one paid more attention to what was going on with the business there were some trademarks there that one could look at and and one would have seen that there were some issues there which later became a lot more significant as they went along in that case for example there was a very strong i would say probability put on the guidance given and not as strong a perspective on some of these other things that were relevant to the company and on and when i did a checklist for the most part we could tell relatively easily what was the factor of factors that a great mind had missed and then we just the factor that got missed we just added that to the checklist okay and once i had all these different factors from all these different investments by great investors i re sorted them by category because they fell into a few different categories and the single largest reason for investment not working out when we looked at all the different failures was leveraged they were they probably we have probably about 30 questions related to leverage in the checklist the second reason why the investment didn t work out was some type of a error or misunderstanding on the moat or comparative advantage of the business that was another big category another probably 20 30 questions and the third was something related to the management of ownership in some nuance on that front and then you get to unions and environment and other things which are more lower down but basically the two or three things that really stood out was which was the biggest issue the capitalism is creative destruction and all businesses are under assault all the time and the ability of a business to withstand those constant attacks for a long period of time is more the exception than the rule and people tend to misunderstand or misjudge if we if we look at a business like apple for example it looks bulletproof right it s such a strong franchise such a strong following and they could raise prices significantly and people aren t going to switch to android or anything you know it s a very strong loyalty there when i look into the future i don t see anything affecting their competitive advantage for 10 years i think i can make a fairly strong case that it s unlikely apple goes into decline by 2032 and such i think it might be cranking till then but i can t make that statement about 2042
what looks stable for five or ten years i have no idea what happens in 15 or 20 years and the thing is if apple has a real problem by 2037 where it s already gone into significant decline that s an issue for people investing today that s a real issue and and these are difficult questions to answer and and that s why i think assessing the durability of a moat is a tough question manish that was a fantastic answer oh thank you now you have the whole checklist you all see don t think i wasn t taking notes a question from jared thanks cameron and definitely appreciate you taking the time on each i think a question that i havewhen we think about investment management and in particular there are alternative investments you know i d love to get your view on what is what is an alternative investment as a it s a pretty broad definition and then you know i think in terms of understanding where companies that are you know alternative asset managers currently are really concentrated on growing that asset base through retail distribution channels and we d love to kind of get your viewpoint on is that a positive is that a negativeand ultimately if if you re a retail investor how should you be thinking about where you re putting your money from an asset management perspective that s a good question i people lose me when they say alternative investment because i think that s a really big tent it doesn t really say much but i would say that some of these efforts to move some of these investments into the hands of retail investors maybe good if the manager is good and the the quality of the assets and such are good if a retail investor historically did not have access to let s say infrastructure investments or class a office buildings and different things like that where it was much more limited i don t think it s much whether these whether it s right or wrong to direct these at retail i don t think that s much the issue i think the bigger issue i have is is the manager good are the assets good and other returns likely to be good and if those factors are met then if they are directed i think in our regulatory frameworks there are a lot of checks and balances to protect the individual retail investor there s a lot of pieces in place there and and i think that the more important thing is how does a manager think and how is he likely to do and is the risk muted and if those are in place then it s perfectly fine i don t see much of an issue i think even when retail investors invest in mutual funds which are holding 100 stocks how much they understand about those holdings i think the difficult the difficulty is not in the disclosures i think the difficulty is that people don t do the work it s not much an issue on the investment manager side i think that there s more education needed or the retail investor that if you re going to step away from passive and such then you really need to roll up your sleeves and do the work and most retail investors aren t willing to do that they end up in places where they shouldn t be that makes sense thanks for that question jared arvin i see you have your hand raised hi i m monish really great to meet you i m ala clemson alumni go tigersmy question to you is is going back to the you you were talking about that turkish bottle manufacturer i m just curious you know when you re looking at firms you know when you re looking for some of these like hidden gems in like emerging markets is there a specific strategy that maybe you use personally to try to uncover some of theseyou know companies that are good to invest in the long term what i did in turkey was that i have a good friend who s a investment manager in turkey and he s he s overdosed on graham and i m trying to get him to overdose more on monger but he comes to omaha and he s from our side of the tent if you will i understand how he thinks because he s following those similar frameworks i base basically just said to him in 2018 that hey would you mind if we just visited companies that are in your portfolio i wasn t interested in visiting any company in turkey that he didn t actually have an investment because i wanted to look at business that had already gone through one filter that he d actually put dollars against it not some business that he thought might be good or he was researching or something and i found that exercise very useful because he was very knowledgeable about the businesses and i could look at the businesses and draw my own assessments about them and i continued that in 2019 we again went and visited more businesses in his portfolio and that s when we met the warehouse operator and other businesses like that i think that i m looking i think that when i step out of the u s when i go outside the u s shores governance becomes really important integrity becomes really important a bunch of things that i take for granted in the u s just don t apply the odds that i would lose money in the united states public markets from outright fraud are minuscule it s happened in the past but it s never happened to me and it s unlikely to happen to me the odds i would lose money in the u s because i m stupid is very high we just i think here in the us we need to protect against stupidity we don t need to protect much against fraud i think when we go into places like turkey we have to first make sure that we have eliminated fraud risk and governance risk and then we can go into the business and such how hard is that to due diligence like i said that s why i took the stance of going in and looking at businesses that my friend already owned because i knew that because when i talked to them about different management teams he s got 20 years history on the person because it s known in the community and different things that i would never uncover no matter how much i worked at it and it made it relatively easy because i could get a lot of data on these businesses i would not have the wherewithal to go into a place like turkey and just start running screens that just is a recipe for disaster okay that s great if anybody has another question please raise your hand i will ask one while we wait you know buffett has chosen to compound his capital and then give it back at some point you ve chosen to start your philanthropy philanthropic endeavors while you re still alive why the difference and i think the the issue is that i thought that giving money away is a lot more difficult than making it this was a notion i had about 16 years ago when i started and i think that s it s proven out i agree with that statement even more now than i did earlier and i didn t want to get to being 80 years old and then having to figure out what to do the only thing i could do at that point was write checks if my brain was still functioning that s all i could do is just write checks and and probably those checks might not go to the right places because i hadn t spent enough time looking at things what i wanted to do was i wanted to start early not with very large amounts i committed when i was like 42 or something to give away two percent of my net worth every and two percent is not going to put me in the poor house and hopefully we re compounding at more than two percent the net worth s actually going up every year and and i expected probably because i was doing much work in india that i d probably get my head handed to me for the first 10 years and that would be fine that d be the tuition bill to play and then in the 11th year onwards i d actually be able to make a difference and what actually ended up happening is we got traction in a first few weeks and we hardly got our head handed to us it was really fast and the ro ro roi the social return invested capital that production gets in india is off the charts it s just actually worked out 10x better than i ever thought possible and basically that 15 16 years has given me a lot of experience and knowledge and now we ve been looking at scaling it scaling it up but i still won t i still am not looking at scaling it where a quarter of my net worth is going into the charity next next year or something we still we keep ramping it up but i ll keep increasing the amounts as my expiry date approaches i used to think that i was going to leave planet earth on june 11th 2044
and recently i found out that i m actually leaving june 11 2054
i suddenly got 10 more years and and i got if it s 2054 i got 32 years left the good news with knowing when you re gonna exit planet earth is then you can plan backwards and now now that i know my expiration date i know what i got to do in the next 10 years in the next 20 years and then by the time i m getting close to six seven years left it needs to be on the chuck freeney plan if you guys have heard of chuck freeney where the idea is that one day before departure if i do this right june 10th 2015 54
there should be a hundred dollars left i know billy has a question but i can t not ask how did you come up with june 11 2054 well you know anytime you want to know an answer to any question like that you just go to god google and you go to god google and say hey god google can you tell me when i m gonna god google will tell you when you re gonna die and if god google doesn t tell you a good answer then go to the metlife website and they ll tell you and then my birthday is june 12th i think it should be poetic just it s exactly one day before the birthday you can add that you can add the exact day but the year they ll give you the year that s great billy last question is yoursthank you very much i think it s a wonderful conversation you know and you even have my experience in age learned quite a bit but my question really focuses on defining value investing versus growth investing you know with a lot of students here you hear that phrasethe couple of coral iris that is does it matter whether it s growth or value considering bill miller one of the great value investors was one of the early investors in aol which was questionable as of whether it s a growth stock which would you know to identified as does that matter to you when you break down that or is it more of what your as you call your evaluation and your long termprognosis for a company is well there are there are two sides of the same coin i think the ideal investment is one that has a long growth runway and even if you were to pay an expensive looking price if you are right on the runway and the growth rate and the length of time that this business can grow and compound walmart would have been a great investment at 50 times earnings in the 70s even 100 times earnings in the 70s because just the runway was long and you would have still had double digit returns paying a very high multiple for a business like walmart when it was really growing a lot of course the difficulty is that it s very hard to look deep into the future like we saw with the apple example how can we know in 1975 what walmart looks like in 2000 for example those are really tough questions the way we kind of hack that is we demand a large margin of safety we say okay we know that this thing could go on for a long time but if it only goes on for 10 years i still don t lose money and that s how you kind of hack around it but the number one thing to look for is great growing businesses that s really the holy grail even the business i invested in turkey the warehouse operator at less than four percent of liquidation value what i m most excited about that business is that when they reinvest capital in dollars or euros they are not willing to do it at below a 25 to 35 percent return their reinvestment and i ve seen it from the beginning i looked at all the things they do these guys don t do dumb things if they can t get their money back and father son that run it the father never went to college he just says if i can t get my money back in three years i m not interested i prefer getting it back in one year and maybe two years but three years is the outer limit and they made an investment they put solar panels all there rooftops and it was 50 million of investment with 10 million a year coming back as what they were getting back in terms of the energy produced i questioned them i said you know five years i said you disappoint me what what went on here they said we really struggled with this but they said we knew it was five years but we all know that those rates are going up quite a bit because turkey has no energy source they import everything they said this was on the edge and it really kind of hemmed and hardly hemmed and not about it but we finally went for it actually it s a great thing because that business that they spent 50 million on they could sell it for 200 million today because it s a solar panels that were deployed 35 40 years ago are still producing power the ones that are being deployed today which are much more advanced than the ones 35 years ago they may be around 60 or 70 years from now that that runway is incredible and i told them glad you lowered your bar a little bit and got that done because that was a good deal and they said it was just right on the edge
created checklist mainly the i guess the framework i used and this was i think about 14 14 years ago was i looked at investments that were made by great investors where the results were negative they lost money and that is really kind of public knowledge because we have 13 f filings they file when they buy and 30 so we were able to figure out you know which investments warren buffett made where he made money or lost money or you know a number of investors that we respect then the second question we asked is if a business if a investment ended up with a negative return was there data available before the investment may first of all we understand try to understand why did the investment work and then the third question we asked ourselves was was that visible before the investment was made so for example so exa for example sometimes and so let s let s take the example of usa was an investment warren buffett had made a long time ago and it did not it did not go well in the end he ended up not losing money but for a while it was it did not do well and the reason it did not do well was he misread the moat so southwest airlines had come in they were low cost provider and they really hammered us air s pittsburgh hub and so on and that was visible that was visible before the investment was made so it was related to competition and moves misreading of competition and modes so what ended up happening when we created this checklist was it fell into a number of very nice buckets why did investments not work the largest single logic reason investments did not work was leverage so leverage has been an achilles heel for a lot of the second biggest reason was some kind of misunderstanding on the more competitive advantage of the business so the investor basically misunderstood or basically couldn t couldn t really figure out that the board was not as deep and wide as they thought they were then they were the third issue was you know things like management ownership there were issues with the nature of management of the nature of ownership which again was visible before and then you got into some other issues like unions things like that so but these three were the big ones right leverage emotes and management and so the checklist ended up i think currently the checklist i use has about 170 questions on it and it it really carries more than its weight in a big way so when i have done the research on investment before i pull the trigger i run the checklist and what happens is the biggest value it adds is they will usually be at least seven eight or ten questions which i do not know the answer to and that is the biggest i would say benefit of the checklist because it forces me to do more research and sometimes to answer those 10 questions might take another month or two of figuring it out and then we can again go back and run the checklist when we have all those answers then we are able to see what are the weak points in the business what could cause a problem and when we can see that then we can make a go no go decision because there are no businesses which have no issues every business has issues the question is how how does it kind of lay out and how comfortable can you get with the issues surrounding the business like for example in 2012 we invested in fiat chrysler and we knew the auto industry is horrible we also knew that all the union contracts had been redone and detroit had become a great place to make cars and so on and the markets did not yet understand that and so that is an example of you know digging in and going in even when there were unions and there were comparative advantage issues
i know that you can probably never have all the information before you go into a decision but how do you find that stopping point where you say you know i think i have enough information that i feel comfortable making this trade yeah that is a great question actually i think with any investment you re looking at let me just i ll take a tangent and come back to your question many years back i was talking to charlie and he encouraged me to discuss my investments not so much with an analyst who might work for me but with a peer investor who cared about me and was a good investor so he said i always had someone to talk to he said monitor it s a big advantage because sometimes we as investors have blind spots so i told them also like in your case charlie for example you have warned to bounce investment ideas off he says well it was not always worn but it s very helpful to have somebody who you can discuss your ideas with so we all have our circle of competence we all have our blind spot so one thing that is useful is to generally bring your ideas to some person whose trust who you trust and who cares deeply about you and is also a good investor that is an important thing but i think beyond that you obviously want to get to an aha moment which is telling you here s all the reasons why this investment is a no brainer and the world does not get it but eventually they will and here s why it makes sense i think that the what i have found in you know 25 plus years of investing is the greed portion of our brain can sometimes mislead us and so it s really important to have circuit breakers on that greed one of the circuit breakers i have is i have a pre investment checklist it has like 160 or 170 questions on it and i run any investment through those questions before i invest and the big value the checklist adds is that the first time i run it it ll pop up maybe 10 or 20 questions but i do not know the answer and what that says to me is listen dummy you are not done with the work you can t even answer these questions so first go and figure out the answer and figuring out that answer might take several weeks of work which is fine or might might take several days and once you can answer all the questions intelligently the checklist has done its job it s going to highlight things that are likely possible failure points in the investment every single company you can come up with scenarios where that business is going to have struggles in the future and the question you re trying to answer is what are the likelihood probabilities that that happens or does not happen in that business versus what you think are the good things that could happen in the business so i think the circuit breaker is important talking to somebody you trust is important being patient and thinking through why something would not work or what are the issues that could cause a permanent loss of capital that is where the focus needs to be the upside will take care of itself i think your aha moment is already probably showing an upside the question is how do you protect the downside could you go through an example not a current holding but maybe a former holding that either worked really well and you learned a lesson from or worked not so well and you learned a lesson from just to sort of put some of this into practice yeah i mean i think that we do not really learn much for the businesses that we do well with you know those just feel great you know well done monish that is about it that is all you re going to get out of those investments it s the failures i mean that is the same thing when you re in school the classes that are easy a s do not teach you much the classes that you have to struggle and you maybe get a b or your you know c level as c average trying to pull a b out or whatever those are the ones that really teach you a lot in investing and that is why it s always important to have a real portfolio a real brokerage account not do this through a spreadsheet because you need to feel the pain you need to feel the pain when you because you will lose money it s guaranteed you know john templeton said one and one out of three times we re going to be wrong when we invest at least one out of three times i think that failures teach you a lot in 2008 for example i had an investment in a some subprime mortgage lender delta financial went to zero that was painful because we had a we had a concentrated portfolio we had 60 70 million invested in it and it all went to zero i have had a number of difficulties over the years with investments in finance and banking companies and i have come to the conclusion that i do not need to go there so generally speaking if a bank comes up on the radar i do not even bother to look anymore i just say it s a pass okay now if you look at someone like warren buffett in his entire career he believe never been wrong on a banking investment and he used to have an investment in a bank in illinois first rockford in the 1960s was one of the first acquisitions berkshire had done and i have a friend who used to be an intern at first rockford at that time and he would say that warren would show up once a month to visit first rockford from omaha he traveled there and he said the whole place would be in a frenzy for several days before warren showed up because they knew you know he never forgets a number he s asking a bunch of questions but that particular bank was probably one of the best run banks in the country their write offs of bad debts for decades approached zero so the it was a single branch bank in rockford the the founder knew all the major business owners and your founder was very deeply involved in all the underwriting decisions so pretty much every loan you know and he had to approve it and he was not going to approve loans loans to deadbeats and they had an exceptional track record in terms of how they with the loans and buffett is a really good banking analyst he had investments in wells fargo jp morgan bank of america you know m t bank on and on every one of them has been a home run and it s worked out really well for him on the other hand if you look at his track record with retailers it s been terrible and he does not talk about it much because he does not like to you know discourage his managers but i would say that almost all of the retail investments berkshire hathaway has made which have been dozens of retail investments only a couple of them have done really well you know nebraska furniture mart has done well borshams have done well almost every other jeweler they bought has done terribly almost every other furniture operation they bought has done terribly and almost every other retail operation they bought has done terribly because in general retail is just so hard it s so hard to do well that even a warren buffett struggles so there are sic codes where warren excels and there are sic codes where warren does poorly and that is the situation with all of us and the earlier you figure out what you re really good at and what to avoid like i have figured out it i took a lot of painful arrows in the back i wish i knew this 25 years ago and but you know i do not really want to own banks or finance companies i repeatedly get holes with those and so i m i m done you know enough for a lifetime on the other hand i have done very well in other areas where i mean like in a lot of commodity businesses which are low cost those have worked really well low cost producers and a number of different kinds of businesses which i have been able to handicap well have worked out well
